Overall Design Goals
The revamped mbernier.com should feel more lively and inviting while remaining professional and credible. To achieve this, the design will introduce a warmer color palette instead of the current stark black-and-white. A few well-chosen accent colors (perhaps a rich blue or green for trust, or warm hues for friendliness) will be used to bring visual interest without overwhelming the content

freelancecake.com
. Ample white space is important for clarity, but we will dial back excessive blank areas that disrupt content flow. Too much padding between related elements can interrupt the user’s visual journey
rob-tomlinson.com
, so spacing will be balanced to maintain a clean look and keep related items grouped intuitively. Typography will be updated to a font that is both approachable and professional. We’ll avoid ultra-technical or sterile fonts, as well as anything overly whimsical. Instead, a modern humanist sans-serif (for example, Nunito, Inter, or Varela Round) can convey warmth and friendliness while staying clean and easy to read
designmodo.com
. Headings and body text will be clearly hierarchically styled for readability and consistency. All UI components and styling will be implemented with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a unified design system. Using Tailwind utility classes will help keep the look and feel consistent across the site, since Tailwind draws from a predefined design system for spacing, colors, and typography
tailwindcss.com
. This means components like buttons, cards, and forms will share the same spacing scale, color palette, and fonts, reducing the chance of any single page looking off-brand. The overall effect should be a site that feels polished and trustworthy, yet with a personal touch of warmth that reflects Matt’s personality. Consistency is a top priority in the redesign. We will establish a cohesive style guide (color scheme, font sizes, spacing rules, etc.) and apply it uniformly. For instance, article preview cards will have the same styling on the homepage as they do on the article index – this consistent treatment reinforces predictability for users
uxpin.com
uxpin.com
. Likewise, reusable components (like navigation menus, footers, tag badges, buttons) will look and behave identically across pages, which shortens the learning curve for visitors and signals a high level of professionalism
uxpin.com
. Tailwind CSS will aid in this by allowing the creation of shared utility classes or components (using @apply or component libraries) so that design decisions (hover effects, shadows, corner radius, etc.) are made once and reused everywhere. In summary, the goal is a design that feels cohesive, inviting, and modern – a true digital business card for Matt that enhances his credibility rather than undermines it

.
Color, Imagery, and Visual Warmth
To add visual warmth, we’ll incorporate a strategic color palette beyond grayscale. This might include a primary brand color (e.g. a blue or teal that conveys confidence and calm) paired with a warmer secondary or accent color (e.g. an orange or soft red for calls-to-action or highlights). Using a fresh palette that isn’t just the default black/white will help the site stand out among “bland, conservative” competitors
freelancecake.com
, yet we’ll choose hues that align with a professional tech/services brand. For example, subtle background tints or section dividers in a light warm-gray or pastel could break up white backgrounds and make the pages feel more approachable. We can also introduce color through imagery: perhaps convert the hero portrait to color instead of black-and-white, or use colored overlay filters on images for a consistent tone (as one consultant site did with branded tints on stock photos
freelancecake.com
). Visual elements like icons or illustrations could use the accent colors to inject personality. Imagery will be used to humanize the site. Currently the headshot and some project images exist; we should ensure high-quality images are in place – especially a friendly, smiling profile photo of Matt to establish trust (people like to see who they might be working with)
freelancecake.com
. If Matt has worked with notable companies or clients, their logos could be showcased subtly on the homepage or “Credentialing” page to add social proof (well-known brand logos signal credibility at a glance
freelancecake.com
). Graphics or icons will have a consistent style (likely flat design or simple line icons with the new color accents) to avoid looking like random clipart. Overall, introducing a bit of color and imagery will make the site feel “alive” and personal, rather than a sparse black-and-white document.
Typography and Tone
As mentioned, typography will strike a balance between technical and friendly. A sans-serif font with slightly rounded forms can subconsciously convey that warmth and approachability
designmodo.com
. We’ll maintain a professional tone by using clean font weights (regular for body, bold for headings) and avoiding anything like cursive or overly decorative fonts which could seem unprofessional. For example, we might use a combination like Inter or Source Sans Pro for body text (highly legible, modern) and maybe a complementary display font or a heavier weight of the same font for headings. All text will remain dark (for contrast) on light backgrounds, but we can use the accent color for certain headings or hover states to carry the branding. We will also ensure text sizes are optimized for readability (e.g. body text ~16px or higher) and line-heights are generous but not too loose, to avoid a cramped or conversely a sparse feel. In short, the typography should make the content feel clear and accessible, with a touch of personality matching Matt’s voice (which we’ll preserve – more on that under Tone & Content Strategy).
Layout and Spacing
The current layout has a lot of whitespace, which while clean, can be toned down. We will utilize a consistent spacing scale (via Tailwind’s spacing utilities) to give the design breathing room without wasting screen real estate. Key content (like section headers, call-to-action buttons) should not be so far apart that they feel unrelated. According to UX best practices, too much whitespace can make a design feel “void and lifeless” and even confuse users about where to look next
rob-tomlinson.com
. We will tighten up margins between section elements that belong together – for example, the article cards on the homepage can likely be moved closer to their section title, and the section title closer to the intro text, so it reads as one unit. Likewise, we might reduce top/bottom padding on the hero a bit so that more content appears without scrolling (“above the fold”), especially on smaller laptops. We’ll still preserve enough whitespace for an uncluttered look; the goal is optimal spacing that guides the eye logically
rob-tomlinson.com
rob-tomlinson.com
. Each page will be built on a responsive grid (Tailwind’s flex or grid utilities), ensuring good alignment and proportion on different screen sizes. By standardizing spacing (perhaps using multiples of 4 or 8px as a design system rule), the site will feel harmonious. One technique to maintain balance is using subtle background blocks to differentiate sections. For instance, the Services section on the homepage could have a very light colored background fill behind it, distinguishing it from the white background of the hero above and the articles section below – this can psychologically “group” that section without needing huge whitespace buffers. We will also consider using decorative elements like patterns or textures very sparingly to add interest (as one example site suggested, a bit of pattern can make a composition distinctive when balanced with negative space
freelancecake.com
). If used, these will be low-contrast and not distract from text.
Tailwind CSS Implementation
All these visual choices will be implemented with TailwindCSS classes for efficiency and consistency. We’ll leverage Tailwind’s configuration to set up custom color shades for the brand palette and maybe custom font family stacks for the chosen typography. Utility classes will handle spacing, layout, and responsive adjustments, so we can rapidly iterate on the design. This approach also makes it easier to maintain consistency – by using the same utility classes (or extracted components) everywhere, we ensure uniform margins, font sizes, etc. A benefit of Tailwind is that we won’t be writing one-off CSS for each page; instead, we’ll build a set of Tailwind-based components for things like: navbars, footers, content cards, buttons, form inputs, badges/pills, and modals. For example, an “article card” component might be a <div> with classes like rounded-xl bg-white shadow hover:shadow-md p-6 flex flex-col gap-2 ... etc., and that same snippet would be used for each article preview on any page – meaning if we tweak its style, it updates everywhere. This ensures visual and functional consistency across the site’s pages
uxpin.com
. In summary, our overall design strategy is to infuse the site with a warmer, more engaging aesthetic while upholding a clean, professional look. With a cohesive style guide and Tailwind-driven implementation, every element from typography to spacing to color usage will work in harmony. The redesign will make visitors feel welcomed and impressed by the site’s clarity and polish – fulfilling the goal of a “technically impressive business card” for Matt that instills trust from the first glance.
Homepage Revamp
The homepage is the front door to Matt’s digital presence, so it needs to immediately communicate who he is, what he offers, and invite visitors to explore further. We will preserve the effective elements of the current homepage (like the concise hero introduction) but enhance them with interactivity and better content balance. Here’s the plan for each section of the homepage:
Hero Section (Introduction): The hero currently has a strong, simple introduction (“Hi, I’m Matt Bernier…”) which is good. We will look to make this hero more dynamic and engaging. One idea is to include a rotating or interactive display of recent activity – for example, beneath the main tagline we could showcase a “Latest update” that automatically pulls in something like the title of the most recent blog article or project, with a link. This could appear as a short line like “Latest Article: <em>Title of Recent Post</em> →” or a small carousel that flips between “Latest Article” and “Latest Project” highlights. This gives returning visitors something new to notice each time and signals that the site is actively updated. If rotating content feels too busy, another approach is a subtle animation or micro-interaction: perhaps the Hire Me button could have a gentle pulse or an arrow icon that slides in, drawing attention to the primary call-to-action. We might also use an eye-catching background element in the hero – for example, a faint geometric pattern or a very light gradient using the accent color – just to add visual interest beyond plain white. The hero should continue to include Matt’s photo (possibly switching from black-and-white to color for warmth), name, and tagline, as well as the primary CTAs (“Hire Me”, “View Resume”, etc.). We will ensure the value proposition is crystal clear in this top area, as that immediately sets context for new visitors
freelancecake.com
. For instance, a concise subtitle could be added: “Fractional Product Management & Technical Consulting to turn ideas into outcomes” (or similar), so the niche and value are obvious. This addresses the advice that a clear value proposition high in the homepage makes a site far more effective
freelancecake.com
. Any dynamic content in the hero should be secondary to this main message – it should complement, not confuse. Overall, the hero will remain relatively clean but feel more engaging through these enhancements.
Featured Articles Preview: On the current homepage, recent articles are shown but the cards are quite large and spaced out. We will redesign these article cards to be more compact and consistent with the new style. Each article card can be a smaller card with the title, a brief excerpt, and meta info (date and maybe a category). We’ll remove any overly large tag lists here to keep them tidy (just as we plan for the main Articles page). Possibly, showing 3-4 latest posts in a grid or horizontal carousel could use space more efficiently than one-per-row as currently. By shrinking these cards (using smaller excerpt text and maybe a smaller thumbnail if applicable), we can fit more content above the fold and avoid large empty gaps. The design of these cards will match the article index page’s cards for consistency – e.g. a card with a white background, subtle shadow, rounded corners, and a hover effect to indicate clickability, along with a consistent placement of the title and metadata. We’ll also visually align this section with the rest: for example, use the same card width as the project cards below (so the layout grid feels uniform when scrolling). Reducing excessive whitespace here means maybe using a two-column layout on desktop for article cards, so that the section height is shorter. That way, visitors can see the services section below without needing to scroll too far, keeping all key offerings in view quickly.
Services Section (Homepage preview): The homepage currently lists services in a fairly plain manner (a simple list of categories). We plan to redesign the Services teaser section to be more dynamic and confidence-inspiring. One approach is to create a carousel or tabbed interface where perhaps the two main service lanes (Fractional Product Management and Technical Consulting) are highlighted. For example, the section could have two tabs or toggle buttons for the two service types, and when you toggle, it shows a short description or recent success story for that service, along with a “Learn more” link to the full Services page. Alternatively, we could feature a summary of each service lane side-by-side in two columns, each with a representative icon or illustration. The key is to make this section visually distinct – possibly by using a different background (like a faint color wash behind it) or graphical elements – so that it stands out as important. We want to instill confidence here, so we’ll include a brief statement of value for each service lane (e.g., “Drive product strategy without the full-time cost” for fractional PM, or “Solve complex technical problems on-demand” for consulting). We can also incorporate a small bit of social proof if available: for instance, “Trusted by [Client A], [Client B]...” or a short testimonial quote right in this section. Social proof sprinkled across the site builds credibility
freelancecake.com
, and having even a single line like “Matt quickly took our product from idea to launch, we couldn’t have done it without him” – along with a client name – in the homepage services area could greatly increase trust. Visually, instead of a bullet list, we might use card-style highlights or an image+text layout for each service to make it more engaging. For example, an icon of a roadmap for Product Management and an icon of gears for Technical Consulting next to their descriptions. A “Learn More” button will lead to the dedicated Services page, and a prominent CTA like “Contact Matt to Discuss Your Needs” could also appear here to prompt conversions (perhaps below the service summaries). Additionally, we plan to embed a “Related Articles” modal or link in this section. The idea is that for each service, we could have a link like “Relevant reading: How I Improved X with Y” that when clicked, pops up a modal with a quick summary of a related blog article (or list of articles) that demonstrate Matt’s expertise in that area. For example, under Fractional Product Management, a link “Read how fractional PM saved a startup
rattleback.com
” might open a modal showing an article summary or case study. This keeps users on the page (they can read a bit and then close, rather than navigating away) while providing proof of expertise. It aligns with the strategy of providing case-study-like proof on service pages to reassure clients
rattleback.com
. Embedding it as a modal rather than a normal link means we satisfy curiosity without fully diverting them off the homepage path. We will design the modal with Tailwind (likely a nice centered card with overlay background) and ensure it’s mobile-friendly. If implementation is complex, a simpler way is to have one featured article with an excerpt directly in the services section as a callout box. The goal is to tightly connect Matt’s content (blog posts) with his offerings, reinforcing that he knows his stuff.
Tools & Resources Section: The current homepage has a “Tools & Resources” section which might be linking to the /links page or listing recommended tools. In its current form it might not be very engaging. We have two options: redesign it or remove it from the main page. Given the goal of focusing the homepage on Matt’s services and content, we might lean towards removing it from this prime real estate, or significantly condensing it. The “Links” (tools/resources) could live on its own page (as it already does) and perhaps be just referenced in the footer (e.g., “Recommended Tools”). If we keep a presence on the homepage, it should be minimal – perhaps a single callout like “Explore my recommended tools and resources →” without listing many items. The rationale is to declutter the homepage and not distract from the primary goal (promoting Matt’s services and expertise). Many consulting/freelancer sites keep resource lists off the main landing page to maintain focus. We can instead use that space for something more relevant to conversion, or simply have a shorter homepage. I suggest likely removing this section from the homepage, or folding a small link to it in another section, unless data shows it’s a big draw.
Footer and Other Elements: Not explicitly mentioned, but as part of homepage design we’ll ensure the footer includes quick links to important sections (especially since “Work/Credentialing” will be moved there). The footer can also reiterate a contact call-to-action (“Interested in working together? Let’s talk!” with a contact button) and social media icons for Twitter, LinkedIn, etc., to serve as a secondary encouragement for visitors who scroll to bottom
rattleback.com
 (since by then, if they aren’t convinced, a final nudge can help). The header navigation will be simplified if we remove Work from it, which is good to “keep links in the main nav to a minimum” for clarity
freelancecake.com
. So the homepage will clearly guide a visitor: Hero intro → Recent Articles/Projects (proof of activity) → Services (offerings and how to engage) → then footer (with credential link and contact info).
In implementing the above, we’ll use TailwindCSS components to maintain consistency. For example, both article and project preview cards on the homepage might use a shared “card” class with the same padding, border, and shadow. Headings for each section (“Recent Articles”, “Latest Projects”, “Services”) will likely use a uniform style (same font size/color). This matching of styles reinforces a cohesive design language
uxpin.com
. By the end, the homepage should present a compelling snapshot of who Matt is and entice visitors to either read more (articles/projects) or convert (check services or contact). It will be aesthetically engaging (through the warm colors, images, interactive elements) and structurally effective (clear sections with not too much empty space). As one expert noted, putting a few key benefits of working with you high on the homepage is a great practice
freelancecake.com
, so we’ll try to incorporate that as well – perhaps as a short bulleted tagline or in the services area. For example: “Why work with Matt? 1) 15+ years experience, 2) Technical & product expertise, 3) Flexible engagement (fractional or project-based).” Presenting 2-4 quick benefits near the top can immediately communicate value to potential clients
freelancecake.com
. Little touches like that, combined with the design overhaul, will make the homepage truly function as a modern, trustworthy business card for Matt.
Articles Page Improvements
The Articles section (“Thoughts, ideas, insights…”) is where Matt’s expertise shines through content. We want this page to be inviting and easy to navigate, so readers can find content that interests them without feeling overwhelmed. The redesign will focus on streamlining the layout (especially handling of tags) and making sure the article listings are consistent in style and usability.
Simplify Tag Display and Filtering: Currently, the articles page shows a large number of tag “pills” for each post or at the top, which can be visually overwhelming (the screenshot shows many colored pills for every conceivable topic). We plan to eliminate the excessive tag pills in their current form. Instead of listing a dozen tags under each article excerpt, we can consolidate how topics are shown. One approach is to use a smaller set of categories or primary tags for display (for example, show one or two main categories per post, rather than every tag). Alternatively, we can move the tag browsing experience to a sidebar or a filter dropdown. For instance, have a filter UI at the top of the page: a dropdown or toggle for major categories (Product Management, AI, Engineering, etc.) and maybe a search box. This way, a user interested in a specific topic can filter the list, but we’re not bombarding everyone with all tags at once. Using a filter system with categories/tags will make the page cleaner and also more useful for discovery. The tag pills, if kept at all, will be restyled to be smaller and subtler (e.g., a light gray background with small text) to avoid dominating the design. By prioritizing a few key categories, we guide readers without distracting them. (For example, showing “Category: Agile Methodology” is more helpful than seeing 10 separate tag chips like “agile, scrum, team, sprint, retrospective, etc.” for one article.) This aligns with common blog design practices where tags are accessible but not front-and-center clutter. In summary, tags will either be moved to a filter toolbar or drastically minimized in the listing view.
Consistent Article Card Design: Each article preview on the index will be presented in a card format that matches what we use on the homepage. This means a clean summary card with perhaps: publish date, title, a 2-3 line excerpt, and maybe a single category or reading time. The style will use the same Tailwind card utilities (padding, rounded border, shadow) for a subtle elevated look. Currently, if the homepage cards and articles page cards differed, we will unify them so the user experience is seamless when moving between pages. Consistency enhances the professional feel
uxpin.com
. We will likely remove redundant metadata – for example, if an article’s tags are no longer all displayed, we might show just the date and maybe one category. The title will be the most prominent element (linked to the full post). We’ll ensure the typography hierarchy is clear: title as a larger font, meta info in a smaller, muted tone, excerpt in normal text. This consistent design not only looks better, but it also sets user expectation (they can tell at a glance what is an article preview and what to click). We should also maintain a consistent hover or interaction pattern: perhaps when you hover a card, it slightly raises or the title color changes (using Tailwind hover: classes). This gives subtle feedback and makes the site feel more interactive.
Visual Pagination and Structure: The articles page likely paginates if there are many posts. We want to improve the pagination controls both visually and in terms of UX. Instead of a basic “Older/Newer” text link or a default pager, we can implement a more stylish Tailwind-styled pagination component. For example, a centered bar with “« Prev” and “Next »” buttons, and/or numeric page links (1, 2, 3...). These can be styled with rounded buttons or minimal underline styles consistent with site buttons. The goal is to make it very clear how to navigate older posts, and have the controls be easily tappable (on mobile, we might just have Next/Prev). We could also consider if infinite scroll or a “Load more articles” button is appropriate, but given an index, a traditional pagination is fine if made prominent. We will ensure the pagination component matches our UI theme (using the accent color for the active page or hover, etc.). Structurally, we might also add a short intro blurb at the top of the Articles page (if not already there, though the screenshot text “Thoughts, ideas, insights on...” is a good intro). We can style that intro as a nice header with maybe a separator line below it to clearly start the list.
Responsive Layout and Readability: On wide screens, we could use a two-column grid for article cards to use space efficiently (so not one very long column of full-width cards). On mobile, it will naturally stack one per row. Tailwind’s grid or flex utilities will help here. This ensures that on desktop the page doesn’t require excessive scrolling to see multiple posts at once. We will also maintain adequate whitespace around cards so it doesn’t get too dense – a comfortable margin between each card so the eye can focus on one at a time, but not so much that it looks sparse (again the balance of whitespace).
Content Highlights: Although not explicitly asked, we might consider adding featured labels or sorting if needed. For example, if Matt has cornerstone articles he wants to surface, we could pin one at the top as “Featured”. But if chronological order is fine, we’ll keep it simple.
In summary, the Articles page will transform from a potentially cluttered list of posts and tags into a clean, easy-to-browse archive of Matt’s writing. By reducing the visual noise of tags (maybe moving them to a filter mechanism) and standardizing the card design, the content itself will shine more. Readers interested in a topic will find it easier to navigate (via a clear category filter or search), and those just browsing will not be intimidated by a wall of multicolored tags. The page’s improvements will encourage deeper reading – which in turn supports Matt’s credibility (his articles demonstrate expertise). We will also use this content strategically to funnel interest toward services: within each article summary or perhaps at the top of the page, we might mention “Interested in more hands-on help? Check out Services.” (This touches on cross-linking, which we’ll cover under Tone & Content, but the Articles page is a prime spot to remind readers that Matt offers services). All styling here will be implemented with Tailwind, reusing classes from the homepage. By ensuring things like tag pills styling and card components are consistent, we reinforce brand consistency across the user’s journey from homepage to reading blog posts. The outcome: a professional-looking blog index that feels part of the same site design and makes users want to click into posts.
Projects Page Enhancements
The Projects page showcases Matt’s work (both client projects and personal projects presumably). Our goal is to present these projects attractively, making sure each project is given a consistent, polished appearance. We also need to handle cases where a project might not have an image, and improve how navigation and categorization works on this page.
Project Card Design & Fallback Images: Similar to articles, each project will be listed as a project card – likely containing a project title, a brief description or tagline, and possibly an image or screenshot. We will design these project cards to be uniform in size and style, for a neat grid or list. One challenge is projects that have no image available: currently that might result in an awkward blank space or missing image icon. To solve this, we will implement a fallback image component. Essentially, if a project lacks a specific image, the site will display a default graphic (perhaps a simple pattern or an icon that represents a project, like a toolbox or lightbulb icon in the brand color). This ensures every project card has a visual element, maintaining the grid’s integrity. We can even generate a dynamic placeholder with the project’s name initials or an abstract illustration, to keep it from looking too generic. The idea is similar to providing a default avatar when a user has no profile photo – it keeps the UI looking complete
medium.com
. The fallback will be styled to the same dimensions as regular project images, so cards don’t jump sizes. Each card will have a fixed height area for the image, helping alignment. Using Tailwind, we can create a utility class for these images to ensure they cover the area (object-cover for actual images, etc.). The card’s text area will list the project name (possibly linked to a detail page or external link if provided) and a short description or one-liner explaining what it is. We’ll also include maybe a small badge or label if needed to distinguish client work vs personal project (for instance, a pill that says “Client” or “Personal”).
Topic/Tag Pills for Projects: If the Projects page currently has “topic pills” (perhaps tags like the tech stack or category of project), we will apply the new design language to those pills as well, matching how we handle tags on the Articles page. For example, if we choose to style tags as small rounded labels in gray or in brand color, we’ll use that here too. Consistency in these UI elements is key
uxpin.com
. We might also limit how many tags we show per project to avoid clutter. If filtering by project type or tech is needed, we could implement a filter similarly as with articles. Perhaps a filter for “All | Client Projects | Personal Projects” or by technology (Web, AI, Mobile, etc.) depending on what metadata is available. This wasn’t explicitly requested, but it could improve UX if the list is long and varied. At minimum, we’ll make sure any pills shown are styled the same as elsewhere and are not excessive in number.
Pagination or Loading More Projects: The Projects page should have a visually coherent pagination just like the Articles page. If there are enough projects to paginate, we’ll use the same Tailwind-styled pagination component (with Prev/Next buttons or page numbers). We want this to be consistent so users recognize the navigation controls easily. Alternatively, if the list isn’t huge, we might opt to show all projects on one page or use a “Load more” button. The request specifically mentions replacing default pagination, so likely we implement a custom one that fits the site’s style (for instance, styled buttons with the accent color highlight on hover, matching the other buttons on the site).
Layout and Visual Balance: We can present projects in a grid (maybe 2 or 3 columns on desktop, 1 column on mobile) depending on how much detail is shown. A grid gives a portfolio-like feel. Each project card should align nicely in rows and columns. We will take care to align images vertically as well so that if some descriptions are longer, it doesn’t break the grid drastically – possibly by setting a min-height for the text area or just keeping descriptions succinct. We will also add a bit more imagery or color here: for example, if Matt has logos from clients or if projects have logos, we could display those on the cards for quick recognition. If not, the screenshots or fallback will carry the visual weight.
Project Details and Related Info: Though not directly asked, consider if each project card can link to a detailed case study page or external site. If so, we ensure the link styling is clear (maybe an arrow icon or a “View project” link appears on hover). Another idea: on each project card or detail, reference any related services or articles. For example, a project card could in its description say “(Related Service: Technical Consulting)” or after the description have small links: “Related: [Blog Post about this project]”. This cross-linking can both demonstrate outcomes of Matt’s services and drive internal traffic. We would populate that if the content model has relationships (which we plan to incorporate).
Consistent Calls-to-Action: We might also consider a subtle CTA on the Projects page – e.g., after listing projects, a banner like “Have a project in mind? Let’s work together – [Contact me]”. This reminds visitors that Matt is available to help with their projects. It’s a gentle nudge after showing what he’s done for others.
By implementing these changes, the Projects page will feel like a polished portfolio. No more awkward gaps due to missing images – every project will have a professional look. The use of fallback images and uniform card styles shows attention to detail, which in itself builds trust (a tidy, well-designed site suggests a high level of professionalism
ux.stackexchange.com
). And by aligning the design (cards, tags, buttons) with the rest of the site, the Projects section will seamlessly blend into the overall experience. In terms of Tailwind, we’ll reuse the card component styling from articles but perhaps tweak for a slightly different content (maybe cards are a bit larger to accommodate images). We’ll also possibly create a utility for fallback images using an onerror handler (if using <img> tags) or conditional rendering in our framework of choice to display an <svg> or placeholder when needed
medium.com
. The pagination component code can be shared between Articles and Projects pages, just with different link endpoints. Overall, after the redesign, a visitor browsing the Projects will see a cohesive gallery of Matt’s work, get a sense of the types of projects he undertakes, and easily navigate through them. The improved visuals (images/logos) and the structured layout will make the experience more engaging than a plain list. This showcases Matt’s accomplishments more powerfully and supports the narrative of his capabilities. Each project essentially serves as social proof of skills, and we’re packaging that proof in the best possible way.
“Work” Page -> Credentialing Revamp
The current “Work” page, which likely lists Matt’s work history or resume, will be transformed into a “Credentialing” page. This renaming aligns better with the idea that it’s providing credibility and proof of experience, rather than a mundane job history. We will remove “Work” from the main header navigation (to declutter and because clients might not need a full CV upfront), but we will link this page in the footer for those interested in Matt’s background. Here’s how we’ll overhaul this section:
Rename and Reposition: First, we’ll label the page clearly as “Credentialing” or “My Experience” (if that term is more user-friendly). In the footer, a link might say “Experience & Credentials” so visitors understand what it is. By taking it out of the top nav, we keep the primary menu focused (Home, Articles, Projects, Services, Contact, etc.) and not mix in a resume-like page which is secondary. This aligns with best practice of minimal main nav links
freelancecake.com
 and focusing on what converts (services, content). Users who truly want to vet Matt’s background can still find it easily via footer or perhaps a call-to-action on the Services page (“see Matt’s full background”).
Narrative Style Summary: Instead of a dry, bullet-point chronological resume, we will present Matt’s work history in a more narrative, story-like format. This means possibly writing a short introduction that summarizes his career journey or highlights (“With over 15 years in product management and software engineering across companies like X and Y, Matt has led teams to build Z...”). We want to highlight key achievements and roles without listing every minor responsibility. A narrative could be structured by themes (for example: “Product Leadership: Led product strategy at [Company], resulting in ...; Engineering Management: Oversaw dev teams at [Company] ...” etc.) or by a brief chronological story (“Started at startup X as lead engineer, then moved to Fortune 500 Y as product manager, now fractional CPO for hire…”). The idea is to communicate impact and skills rather than just titles and dates. This will likely be more engaging to read and certainly more memorable
reddit.com
. According to career storytelling advice, a resume or bio should show how you overcame challenges and what results you achieved
indeed.com
 – so we’ll incorporate a couple of concise success stories or results in the narrative.
Highlighted Achievements and Skills: We will pull out a few key achievements in a visually distinct way, perhaps using an icon or mini-infographic style. For example, we might have a section on this page with a few metrics or facts: “$10M+ raised across projects managed”, “20+ products launched”, “Certified Scrum Master”, etc., presented in a 2-3 column grid. These serve as quick credibility indicators. We could also include logos of notable companies Matt has worked for or with, displayed prominently (e.g. “Experience with: [Company A logo], [Company B logo], ...”)

. Many personal sites use a “trusted by” or “worked at” banner because recognizable logos instantly communicate trustworthiness and level of experience
freelancecake.com
. If Matt’s resume includes big names, we’ll definitely showcase those visually.
Linking to Services: To tie this into the rest of the site, we can link parts of the credentialing content to the services. For example, if one of Matt’s past roles was Head of Product at CompanyX, and now he offers fractional product management, we can make a note like “(experience that informs my Fractional Product Management services)” with a hyperlink to the Services page or that section. Similarly, if he has a background in dev/architecture that feeds into his Technical Consulting, we mention it and link. This subtly guides readers: “I have done this before at reputable organizations, and I can do it for you via my services.” It’s about connecting the dots for a prospect reading his credentials.
Tone and Format: The tone here should remain professional but personable. Perhaps Matt can share a quick career story or philosophy – e.g., “Over the years, I’ve learned that aligning product strategy with customer needs is the key to ...” – something that feels like a personal reflection rather than just dry facts. This keeps it authentic and in line with his article tone (authentic, occasionally humorous). However, since this is a credential page, it should still be fairly polished. We might include a small professional photo here (if not using the same from hero) in a context, or even an embedded PDF link to his formal resume for those who want it.
Layout: We can design this page kind of like an “About” or “Resume” hybrid. Possibly a main column of text (the narrative) with sidebars or callouts for skills/tools. For instance, a sidebar could list core competencies (Product Strategy, Agile Coaching, Full-stack Development, etc.) with icons. Or we present timeline elements (maybe a vertical timeline of positions) but keep each item succinct and outcome-focused: e.g., “Company (Year-Year) – Role – one line on major achievement”. If using a timeline, we will use Tailwind styling for vertical spacing and maybe an icon or dot for each timeline point. However, we should avoid a cluttered timeline; if it’s too much, better to just have sections for “Past Roles” summarizing each.
No Redundancy with Resume PDF: If a resume PDF is provided (the user uploaded one), we should ensure the page complements that rather than just duplicating word-for-word. It can be a high-level overview that entices someone to download the full resume if needed, or conversely, it can provide the context and narrative that a resume can’t.
By implementing these changes, the Credentialing page will serve as a compelling credibility booster. It will answer the question a client might have: “Who is Matt and why should I trust him with my project?” at a glance, through narrative and visuals. Removing it from the main nav ensures only those interested (likely a bit further in the funnel) will seek it out, which is fine. But linking it in the footer and from services means it’s accessible when needed. From a Tailwind standpoint, we will style this page using perhaps more typographic styles (quotes, bold highlights for achievements, maybe a nice blockquote for a personal statement). We can use Tailwind’s grid or flex utilities to layout any multi-column sections (for logos or stats). For logos of past companies, we might use grayscale versions to keep it subtle and classy (a common design approach). If including any testimonial on this page (maybe a quote from a former colleague or client about working with Matt), that would be fantastic social proof and can be styled in a quote component (with italic text or a quotation mark graphic). In sum, the “Credentialing” page will turn what might have been a boring list of jobs into a living narrative of Matt’s professional journey, reinforcing the value he brings. This narrative approach is more engaging to read and shows the why and how of his expertise, not just the what. It should leave the reader with a clear impression: Matt has a strong background and he’s the real deal (trustworthy, experienced, and aligned with the services he’s offering).
Services Page Redesign
The Services page is arguably the most critical for converting interested visitors into clients. It needs a major redesign to clearly communicate the value of what Matt offers, establish trust, and drive the visitor toward contacting him. We will structure this page to define the two distinct service lanes (Fractional Product Management and Technical Consulting) and enrich it with persuasive content: value propositions, microcopy clarifications, testimonials, results, and strong calls to action. The design will be engaging and confidence-inspiring, moving away from any bland list format into a compelling sales page for Matt’s services.
Clear Segmentation of Two Service Lanes: We will clearly split the page into two main sections – one for Fractional Product Management and one for Technical Consulting (or whatever exact naming Matt prefers for these lanes). Each section will act almost like a mini landing page for that service, with a consistent format for both so they feel like two offerings from the same person. We might introduce the services with a brief overview up top (“Here’s how I can help you…” with a sentence distinguishing the two, e.g., “Whether you need part-time leadership of your product strategy or expert help solving technical challenges, I offer flexible services in two flavors:”). Then we present each service lane.
Service Overview with Problem-Solution-Benefit: For each service lane, we’ll craft a concise overview that speaks to the client’s perspective. A recommended framework is Problem → Solution → Benefits
rattleback.com
. For example, for Fractional Product Management: “The Challenge: Startups and SMBs need senior product leadership but can’t afford a full-time CPO or wait to find the perfect hire. The Solution: I offer fractional product management – stepping in part-time to drive product strategy, roadmap execution, and team alignment as an on-demand CPO. The Benefits: You get top-tier product leadership at a fraction of the cost and commitment, accelerating your product development and mentoring your team without long-term overhead.” This kind of narrative directly addresses why the service matters to the client and what outcome they can expect
rattleback.com
rattleback.com
. We will do similarly for Technical Consulting: identify common problems (like “Complex technical roadblocks or scaling challenges”), then solution (“I provide hands-on technical consulting, from architecture guidance to AI workflow integration, to quickly overcome hurdles”), and benefits (“so your project stays on track, performance issues are resolved, and your team learns best practices along the way”). Keeping each service overview to about 200-300 words is ideal
rattleback.com
 – enough to be informative but quick to read.
Detailed Features and Deliverables: Following the high-level overview, we can list out specific features or components of each service. For Fractional PM, that might be bullet points like “Product strategy & roadmap planning,” “Cross-functional team leadership,” “OKR/KPI establishment and tracking,” etc. For Technical Consulting, bullets might include “Codebase audit & recommendations,” “Automation of workflows (e.g., AI integration),” “Technical mentoring and workshops,” etc. These bullets act as microcopy that clarify what’s included, but we’ll phrase them in a benefit-oriented way where possible (e.g., “Comprehensive codebase audit – identify issues before they become costly problems”). Microcopy can also address common concerns; for instance, a note like “Flexible engagement: hourly or project-based – you only pay for what you need” might alleviate fear of commitment. We might also incorporate small explanatory tooltips or notes for any jargon (Tailwind can style tooltips or info icons) – for example, if “AI Workflow Integration” is a bullet, a little “(i)” icon could show a definition or example on hover, making it very approachable even to non-technical clients.
Testimonials and Social Proof: To instill confidence, nothing beats hearing from satisfied clients. If Matt has any testimonials or can get a few quotes, we will integrate testimonials prominently on the Services page. Possibly one per service lane if they align (e.g., a quote from a startup founder about how Matt’s fractional PM helped them launch on time; another from a CTO about how Matt’s consulting solved a scaling issue). These testimonials can be displayed in stylized quote cards, perhaps right after the bullet list of features or alongside it in a sidebar. They should include the person’s name, title, and company for credibility. Even short endorsements like “Matt quickly identified issues we hadn’t seen and helped our team double our release pace
freelancecake.com
” add huge trust value. According to best practices, including relevant case studies or success stories on a service page provides proof that you can deliver
rattleback.com
. If full case studies are available, we might have a “Case Study” link or summary on the page as well (or link the Projects page example that correlates with the service, if any). We’ll avoid using just generic “Lorem ipsum”-style testimonials; real, specific feedback is best. Visual cues like client headshot or company logo next to the quote can draw the eye (if permission and assets exist). Testimonials serve to “derisk” the prospect of hiring Matt by showing others have succeeded
freelancecake.com
.
Outcome Statements and Value Propositions: We will incorporate outcome-focused statements throughout. Prospects want to know what result they get. For instance, under fractional PM, an outcome statement might be, “Take your product from vision to market fit without hiring a full-time exec.” Under consulting: “Eliminate bottlenecks and accelerate development with expert guidance on-call.” These could even be styled as subheadings or callout text. We want to hammer home the value: not just what the service is, but what it achieves. Using some numbers or specifics if possible: e.g., “Fractional PM engagements have led to 3 successful product launches in the past year” or “Helped companies raise Series A by refining product strategy” – real data adds credibility (and if Matt has any stats like that, we’d include them). As one example from the research, a consultant boldly listed pricing and results to filter serious clients
freelancecake.com
; while we might not list pricing publicly, being straightforward about outcomes and scope can similarly project confidence.
Calls to Action (CTA) Placement: We will place prominent and repeated CTA buttons throughout the Services page. There should be an initial CTA near the top (after the intro, something like “Get in Touch to Discuss Fractional PM” or a generic “Contact Me” button if one CTA can serve both lanes). Then, after each service lane description, include another CTA – for instance, under Fractional PM section: a button “Inquire about Fractional PM” that scrolls to or links to the Contact page. Similarly for Consulting. Finally, at the bottom of the page, a final CTA banner could say “Ready to solve your challenges or supercharge your product? Let’s talk!” with a contact button. These multiple CTAs ensure that no matter where someone finishes reading, there’s an easy next step. CTA design will use Tailwind styles consistent with the rest (very likely a standout color fill when in normal state and maybe a hover effect). We’ll ensure the wording is action-oriented and clear (e.g., “Contact Matt”, “Book a Consultation”, “Schedule a Call”), and not just a generic “Submit”. According to CTA best practices, clarity and repeated opportunities to convert are key on a services page
rattleback.com
freelancecake.com
.
Visual Design and Confidence Cues: A major redesign includes visual flair to differentiate this page. We can use a slightly different layout for each lane to make them distinct yet aligned. Perhaps the Fractional PM section has a light background color and the Consulting section has white (or vice versa) to visually separate them. We will use relevant imagery: for example, an illustration of a roadmap or strategy session for the PM lane, and a coding or gears illustration for the Consulting lane. Even simple vector icons can suffice, placed near headings or in the background. We should also consider adding an element of Matt’s personal brand/expertise here – maybe a short “Why Me?” subsection: a few sentences or bullet points on why Matt is uniquely suited (tying into his credentials). This might reiterate his experience, but in context of providing these services (e.g., “I blend 10 years of product leadership with hands-on coding skills – meaning you get a product strategist who actually understands the tech.”). It’s a selling point that he has both product and engineering experience. We can also include a FAQ accordion if common questions exist (like “What is fractional product management? How does it work?” or “What kind of projects can you consult on?”). This can alleviate doubts and again build trust by answering things proactively. These would be small and toward the bottom, not to distract from main content.
Microcopy and Tone: We’ll incorporate microcopy to make the page feel conversational and assuring. For example, under a contact CTA, a small line “(Typically responds within 1 business day)” can reassure that reaching out is welcome and will be answered. Or next to service names, a brief tagline: “Fractional Product Management – your on-demand product leader” (friendly yet clear). Microcopy also covers little clarifications, like if we mention “AI workflow integration”, a tiny “(think Zapier or custom scripts – I connect your tools so they work smarter)” could demystify it for a non-technical reader, increasing approachability.
The layout of the Services page will be carefully planned to guide the eye. Likely: Intro paragraph, then Fractional PM section (with maybe a two-column layout: left column text, right column an image or list), then a divider or contrast section, then Consulting section laid out similarly. Each ending in a CTA. Then perhaps testimonials spanning full width, then a final CTA. We’ll use Tailwind’s grid/flex utilities to position text and images nicely (ensuring it collapses to single column on mobile). Visual consistency between the two service sections (similar font sizes for headings, etc.) is important, but we might use color blocking to differentiate them. We’ll also ensure that this page uses slightly larger text and headings than normal paragraphs, since it’s essentially a marketing page – it needs to be very skimmable. Key phrases or benefits might be bolded or pulled out as highlighted text so someone scanning gets the gist (people often skim service pages, so headings and highlights should tell the story). From the content perspective, we’ll maintain Matt’s authentic tone (clear and direct, with a touch of personality). For example, a slight bit of humor in a microcopy or a bold statement could reflect him (maybe a line like “All the product expertise, none of the office politics – that’s fractional done right.” which is a bit playful but still professional). This aligns with advice not to shy away from humor if it fits your style
freelancecake.com
, as it can make the offering more memorable and human. In conclusion, this Services page redesign is about selling Matt’s value in a compelling way. By clearly delineating his two main offerings and backing each with credible proof and clear benefits, visitors will understand exactly what’s on offer and why they should trust Matt to deliver it. The page will exude confidence through both content and design – it will look polished (which implies “this guy has his act together”), read persuasive (speaking to client needs directly), and provide plenty of reassurance (testimonials, credentials, clarity). The combination of these elements should greatly improve conversion from casual visitor to serious inquiry. As the article by Rattleback noted, a service page should provide overview, proof, and a strong CTA
rattleback.com
 – we are doing all of that: overview with problem-solution framing, proof via testimonials/case links, and CTAs inviting contact. This comprehensive approach will make the Services page a powerhouse.
Contact Page & CTAs
The Contact page is where interested visitors turn into leads, so it must be inviting, straightforward, and consistent with the site’s style. We will improve the styling of the Contact page itself, and additionally embed calls-to-action (CTAs) in various places across the site to funnel users toward contacting Matt.
Contact Page Design: We’ll draw inspiration from the screenshot examples provided (the user’s uploads likely show forms or designs they prefer) to restyle the contact form. Typically, a good contact page has a warm introduction, a well-designed form, and perhaps alternative contact info. We will add a short intro text at the top of the contact page, something like “Let’s Connect – I’d love to hear about your project or questions. Feel free to reach out and I’ll get back to you within a day.” This sets a friendly tone and reduces the intimidation of a blank form. The form itself will be styled using Tailwind classes to look modern and clean. We’ll use approachable, consistent form styles: for example, inputs with borders in the brand color or a light gray, maybe with slight rounding (rounded-md), proper padding (p-2 or p-3 for clickable size), and clear labels. We might use floating labels or simply top-aligned labels – depending on the example screenshots. The submit button will of course use the site’s primary button style (likely a solid fill with accent color). We should also incorporate a hover state and focus states on form fields (Tailwind makes it easy to add focus:border-color etc., so the form is accessible and user-friendly). If the screenshots provided had specific color or layout ideas (for instance, maybe a background image or split layout with a form on one side and a photo or contact info on the other), we can mimic that. A popular approach is a two-column layout on desktop: left side a short text and maybe contact details, right side the form. On mobile, it stacks. We will include fields that make sense – name, email, message, and perhaps a dropdown for “interest” if needed (like which service they are interested in), but we’ll keep it as short as possible to encourage completion. Beneath the form, or on the side, we can list other ways to reach Matt: for example, an email address (hyperlinked) and maybe LinkedIn profile link. Some people prefer direct email, so showing that (even if the form goes to the same email) can be comforting. If there’s a business phone or calendar link, that could be included too. Visual enhancements: We can use an icon (like a mail icon or chat icon) near the header “Contact” for a friendly touch. We might also lightly incorporate the accent color in the background or as a sidebar. For instance, one half of the page could have a faint colored background with a pattern (to match the site vibe) where the form sits, and the other half white for text – giving a nice contrast. Importantly, we will make sure the styling matches the rest of the site. If we’ve used rounded corners and shadows for cards, we might give the form container a similar card feel (e.g., a drop shadow box around the whole form area to make it stand out). The font and button style will be same as elsewhere. We want the contact page to feel like a continuation of the brand, not an afterthought.
Inspiration from Screenshots: (Since I cannot see the actual images here, I’ll assume they contained modern contact form designs). Possibly the examples show a contact form with a colored background or some playful elements. If one screenshot showed, for example, a form with a speech bubble design or a map, we could incorporate at least the essence. If none did, we might just stick to proven patterns: a clean section with maybe a slight color background or illustration. One idea: include a small headshot of Matt or a friendly graphic in the contact page to humanize it (“you’re contacting a person, not a faceless site”). Another idea from modern design is to include a brief FAQ on the contact page like “Frequently Asked Questions” (like “What happens after I send this?” – answer: “I’ll reply via email within a day to schedule a call,” etc.). This can set expectations and again encourage submitting the form.
Embedded CTAs across the site: Beyond the contact page itself, we will add CTAs in strategic locations throughout the site content to drive people toward contacting Matt. This includes:
At the end of blog articles: After someone finishes reading an article, especially one that relates to a service Matt offers, we’ll place a short CTA section. For example: a bordered box or highlighted section saying “Need help with [topic]? I offer consulting to help businesses [improve X]. Contact me for a free initial chat.” This converts the reader’s interest (from the article) into a possible lead by pointing them to services. Many blogs do this – an end-of-post CTA – and it’s effective at prompting action from engaged readers.
Within longer articles: possibly a mid-article banner for very long posts, but at least at the end is important.
On Project pages or project detail (if any): If a project is described in detail, we can add a line like “Have a similar project in mind? Let’s work together – [Get in touch]” at the end.
On the Services page: We already plan multiple contact buttons. These effectively are CTAs embedded in content. We might also have a floating or sticky CTA on that page (for instance, as you scroll a small “Ready to talk? Contact Matt” bar could stick to bottom – optional enhancement).
Homepage: The hero already has a Hire Me button (which presumably goes to contact or a scheduling link). We might also ensure the Services section on homepage has a CTA link as discussed. Essentially, no one should have to hunt for how to contact – it should be one click from wherever they are.
Navigation: Perhaps the “Contact” link in the main nav will be styled as a standout button (some sites do this to emphasize it). Since contact is the conversion, maybe we make that link a button style item in the header (like a contrasted color or outline) to draw attention consistently on every page’s menu.
Each embedded CTA will be styled consistently, probably using a small box with accent background or a nice border to set it apart from normal text. We’ll make the text brief, action-oriented, and relevant to the context of the page. For example, on an article about AI tools, the CTA could mention technical consulting for AI integration. On an article about product strategy, mention fractional PM service. This relevance can significantly improve conversion because it connects the user’s interest to the service offering directly
rattleback.com
 (they’ve learned something from the content and see that Matt can actually implement or consult on it).
Technical Implementation of Contact: We should ensure the contact form actually works robustly (with form validation, success message). Possibly integrate an email service or direct email to Matt’s address. We might also consider adding a captcha or spam prevention, but ideally invisibly or minimally intrusive, to keep the UX smooth.
Other Considerations: We will ensure the contact page has the same meta information as others (title, etc.) and maybe track form submissions if Matt uses any analytics/CRM, but that’s behind the scenes. If the user’s screenshots suggested any playful element (like an emoji or drawing), we can incorporate lightly to maintain that approachable feel, in line with the overall site warmth.
By revamping the Contact page with these changes, reaching out to Matt will feel like a natural, positive step for visitors – rather than a cold or difficult task. A well-designed form with a personal touch can significantly increase form submissions. And by peppering CTAs throughout the site, we keep reminding users of the option to contact, which gently pushes those who are interested to take action. According to conversion best practices, having a single primary action (like contacting) repeated in logical places is key to guiding users through the funnel
squarespace.com
. We’ll do exactly that, in a way that feels helpful rather than pushy (the CTAs will be framed as helping the user solve their problem, not just “sell sell sell”). In short, after these improvements, no matter where a user is on mbernier.com – reading a blog, browsing projects, learning about services – they’ll have an easy path to contact Matt. And when they arrive at the Contact page, they’ll be met with a friendly, well-crafted form that reinforces the trust and professionalism established on the other pages, ultimately increasing the likelihood that they will submit an inquiry.
Links Page (“/links”) Redesign
The “Links” page (currently likely a list of recommended tools/resources at links.mbernier.com) will be reimagined as a more engaging Resources or Recommendations hub. We’ll keep the URL as /links for continuity, but visually and structurally it will get a makeover to be more informative and user-friendly. The aim is to maintain a playful vibe (since this is a lighter, less formal section of the site) while staying clean and not overly pushy (we don’t want it to feel like aggressive advertising).
Visual Rebranding: The page will be given a clear title and introduction. Instead of just “Links”, we might title it “Tools & Resources I Recommend” (assuming that’s the content – e.g., SaaS tools, libraries, etc., that Matt endorses). A short intro paragraph can explain that these are products or services Matt finds valuable in his work, possibly with a disclaimer if any are affiliate links. This sets context. We will use a more vibrant design here to differentiate it from the more serious pages: maybe some fun icons or illustrations (like a toolbox icon, or a grid of logos) in the header. The color scheme can be a bit more varied or bright here – for instance, we might allow each resource’s branding (logo colors) to show, which naturally makes it more colorful. The layout will still align with overall site fonts and spacing, but we can afford some more playful touches, such as maybe a dashed underline style on hover or a slight tilt on images (thinking of “sticker” style design as mentioned in an example
freelancecake.com
 – playful but not too chaotic).
Card Design with Descriptions: Each link/offer will no longer be just a hyperlink – we will present them as cards or list items with descriptions. For example, if one of the offers is a product, we’ll show its logo or icon, the name of the tool, and a brief description of what it is and why Matt recommends it. This turns the links page into a useful resource for visitors (they can see what a tool is for and trust that Matt has curated it). It was requested to include descriptions for each offer, and we’ll do so, keeping them concise (one or two sentences each). We might also include additional info like a tag or category (e.g., “Design Tool”, “Productivity”, “Developer Resource”) to give context. Each card might look like: Logo on the left, text on the right (name as link, description, maybe a “→” icon). Or on mobile, stacked. We can use a simple card style or even a more playful list style (some resource pages use an icon and then text indented). But cards could work nicely to separate visually.
Optional Filters by Tag/Category: If the number of resources is large or spans various categories, we’ll add a filter bar at the top. This could be a series of small pill buttons or checkboxes for categories (for example: “All / Productivity / Dev Tools / Reading / etc.”). Clicking a filter would show only those items (which we can implement simply with some JavaScript or if generating statically, maybe separate sub-pages, but a client-side filter is nicer for UX). The search results pointed out that having filters or a search on a resources page is beneficial
nikolaibain.com
nikolaibain.com
. We could also include a search bar if there are many items, but likely a few category filters suffice. We’ll style these filters similarly to our tag pills (so they integrate visually). This way, if a user is only interested in, say, AI tools, they can click that filter to narrow down.
Playful UI Elements: To keep the page lighthearted and not “salesy,” we can add some personality in the copy and design. Perhaps each description has a tiny hint of humor or a personal note (“I use this every day to manage my tasks – it’s like a second brain”). We can also incorporate small graphics – for example, maybe a subtle emoji or icon next to section titles, or decorative separators (like a fun squiggle or doodle between items). The key is to keep it clean – so the overall layout remains organized (lots of whitespace around cards, consistent alignment), but with small pops of color or shapes for playfulness. We might use Tailwind to create a grid of cards that have a hover lift effect or a slight rotate on hover (giving a sense of interactivity and fun).
Not Pushy: If some of these links are affiliate or offers, we’ll be transparent but not pushy. For instance, if there’s an affiliate link, we can label it “(affiliate)” subtly, and perhaps have a note at bottom “Some of these are affiliate links – I only recommend what I truly find useful.” This honesty keeps the tone trustworthy. We won’t use any flashing banners or “BUY NOW!!!” kind of language. The descriptions will focus on utility (“This service simplifies X, great for Y”) rather than “Deal! Click here!” etc. Also, by including Matt’s genuine take in the descriptions, it feels like a friendly recommendation from a colleague, not an ad. That tone will ensure it doesn’t come off as pushy.
Example Layout: Imagine a 3-column layout of cards (on desktop). Each card: has a colored or white background (maybe alternating or all white with border). The logo of the tool is at top (maybe as an image or an embedded icon), below it the name in bold, and then the description text. Under that, perhaps a small link like “Learn more” or an icon that indicates it opens an external site (to be clear they’re leaving to that resource). We might also show a rating or G2 link if relevant (the content model mentions G2 link – if Matt has G2 profiles or something for these offers, we can incorporate that as e.g. a small badge “Rated 4.5 on G2” linking to it). But careful not to clutter – maybe only if it’s meaningful.
Integration with Content Model: We will set it up so these resource entries are easy to update through the backend. Each has a name, description, logo, tags, and a URL (plus possibly an affiliate code or tracking). This page can then be generated from that data. This means going forward, adding a new recommendation is straightforward (no messing with layout).
Responsive and User Experience: On mobile, this will likely be a simple vertical list of items, which is fine. We’ll ensure logos/images scale nicely and don’t overpower text (Tailwind’s utility classes like max-w-xs or similar can constrain images). We’ll also ensure accessibility – each link will have descriptive text (the logo should have alt text in case image doesn’t load, etc.). If we use any icons for external link, we label them for screen readers.
Consistency: Although this page is more playful, we still keep it within the brand’s look. That means same base font, header style, etc. We just might use a slightly different layout. Colors used here will be from the palette chosen, perhaps a bit more saturated for fun. For example, if brand accent is blue, maybe incorporate a secondary accent (like orange or green) in small doses here for category labels or icons, just to visually differentiate categories.
By doing all this, the Links page becomes a valuable resource page that visitors might actually browse and use, instead of a dull link list. It reflects positively on Matt too – curating useful resources shows expertise and willingness to help, which can indirectly support his consulting persona. And since it’s visually engaging, it keeps the user’s interest. One more thing: if the list of resources is long, we might paginate it or lazy-load, but likely it’s manageable. Also, if appropriate, we could allow sorting (like alphabetical or by popularity) but that might be overkill. The request only mentioned filters which we’ve covered. To summarize, the new /links will be a central hub of recommendations, neatly organized, with filtering and descriptions. It will feel like a mini product hunt or toolkit page, rather than just a plain bookmarks page. This kind of page, when done well, can also attract SEO traffic (“Matt Bernier recommended tools for product managers” etc.), so writing good descriptions is beneficial. We’ll implement this all with Tailwind – making use of its grid classes for layout, typography for the text, and perhaps utility-first styling for badges (like a class for tag pills using bg-blue-100 text-blue-800 text-xs font-semibold mr-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded). We have a content model defined for Offers/Links, so each card populates from there, ensuring consistency in how things like tag labels look (which should match maybe the tag style we use elsewhere for coherence). In terms of tone, since the page is a bit less formal, we can inject more of Matt’s voice if desired (“I love this tool because…”). But we’ll keep each entry short – the user can always click through to learn more on the tool’s site. Overall, after the redesign, the /links page will not only be more useful and attractive, but it will also reflect Matt’s brand values – helpfulness, expertise, and a bit of personality – without being an aggressive sales page. It invites exploration in a fun way, while still being organized enough that users can find what they need quickly

.
Content Model & Backend Strategy
To support all these front-end improvements and make the site easy to update, we will develop a robust content model and either a custom backend or adopt a headless CMS. The goal is to have a structured way to manage all of Matt’s content – articles, projects, clients, offers, etc. – and enable dynamic content across the site (like latest updates in the hero, related content links, etc.). We will design a schema for all content types mentioned, and ensure the backend provides APIs for the front-end (likely a Next.js or similar static site) to fetch this data as needed. Here’s the breakdown of the content model:
Articles: We will have an Articles collection that contains fields such as:
title (string) – the title of the blog post.
slug or canonical URL (string) – used for the link, and canonical if syndicated.
frontMatter – essentially metadata like publish date, possibly a short excerpt or description.
content or body – the actual article content (could be markdown/MDX if we use a static site generator, or HTML if stored in CMS).
image (maybe) – a featured image for the article, if any.
categories (list of references or tags) – broad categories the article falls under.
tags (list of strings or references) – more granular topics.
description (string) – a short summary (for SEO or preview text).
readingTime (computed or stored) – e.g., “5 min read”.
Possibly relatedProjects or relatedServices (links to other content).
With this model, we can easily generate the Articles index and detail pages. The categories/tags might be separate collections or just enumerations. If using a headless CMS, we might have a taxonomy for categories/tags to maintain consistency. The API should allow querying articles by tag or category (for the filter functionality).
Projects: A Projects collection with fields:
title – name of the project.
description – a short blurb about the project.
details or content – a longer case study or description (if there is a detail page).
image – URL or asset for a project image/screenshot.
fallbackImage – not a field per se, but we will programmatically handle missing images by showing a default.
client (reference to a Client entry or simply a name and indicator if it’s a client project or personal).
owned (boolean) – or a field indicating if it’s Matt’s own project or a client project.
urls – could be an object with maybe liveUrl, repoUrl etc., links to the project if available.
topics or tags – list of tags for technologies or domain (to use as topic pills).
relatedServices (reference list) – which of Matt’s services this project is related to (for example, a project could be tagged as resulting from Technical Consulting).
relatedArticles (reference list) – any articles written about or relevant to this project.
This model ensures each project knows if it should show a client name or link, what tags to display, etc. The backend can use this to populate the Projects page and any project detail pages. If clients need to be private, we could have a field to toggle visibility of certain info (see Clients below).
Clients: A Clients collection (if needed separately) with fields:
name – client or company name.
logo – the client’s logo image (for use in credentials or case study).
description – maybe what the company does or Matt’s relationship with them.
public (boolean) – if false, this client’s identity should be hidden (we can use a pseudonym or skip showing name on public site).
Possibly projects (reference list) – the projects associated with this client.
We might not expose a direct “Clients” page on the site, but this data helps in displaying logos on the Credentialing page or in case studies. The toggle allows Matt to include client info in backend but only show those he has permission to mention publicly.
Offers (Links): An Offers (or Resources) collection for the /links page with fields:
name – name of the tool/service.
logo – an image or icon for it (URL or asset).
description – a short description of the offer (for the card text).
url – the external link URL (with affiliate code if applicable).
tags or category – e.g., tags like “Design”, “Development”, “Marketing” to filter.
G2link – if the prompt specifically mentions G2 (maybe linking to G2 Crowd reviews), we can store that as well (or a rating).
Possibly priority or featured – if we want to order them or highlight some.
This structure will drive the Links page. We can fetch all offers, group by tag, etc., easily from the API. It also makes adding a new recommended tool a simple content entry rather than hand-coding a new card.
Work History (Credentialing): Perhaps an Experience or WorkHistory collection with fields:
company – name of the company.
logo – company logo (for display in timeline or logos section).
role – title/position held.
duration – dates or years range.
description – a description of what was done or accomplished in that role.
linkToService – reference to a Service if relevant (e.g., link this experience to the type of service now offered).
Possibly an order or date field to sort experiences by most recent.
Alternatively, since we might present the work history narratively, we could store it as one rich text field. But a structured approach lets us list roles easily if needed. We might use a hybrid: a structured list of roles and also an overarching narrative text.
Service Offerings: We shouldn’t forget to model the Services themselves, since those pages have content:
We can have a Services collection with entries for “Fractional Product Management” and “Technical Consulting” (and any others in future).
Fields could include: name, summary (the short overview), description (long form content or bullet points that can be a rich text or JSON structure for features/outcomes), testimonial (reference to a Testimonial entry or just text field), etc., and possibly slug if each service had its own page (though currently they’re sections of one page).
Related: a Testimonials collection might be useful to manage quotes, with fields quote, authorName, authorTitle, company and reference to which service or project it’s related to. That way we can easily fetch and display relevant testimonials on the appropriate pages.
Meta Content: Things like llms.txt, sitemap.xml, robots.txt can be generated from the above data:
llms.txt: We’ll programmatically compile a Markdown or text that lists all important pages (like a summary of site structure and key pages). We might include sections like “Articles: [list of titles with links]”, “Services: [list of services]” etc.
mintlify.com
. Our system can gather all article titles and maybe first headings to populate llms.txt for AI consumption (as per emerging standards).
sitemap.xml: straightforward using all page URLs from the content (articles, projects, etc.).
robots.txt: likely static, but if we needed to, we can include dynamic directives (like allow/disallow certain paths if needed, though not heavily dynamic).
Additionally, things like RSS feed for blog can be generated from the Articles model.
Platform and Implementation: We have choices:
A custom backend: e.g., a Node.js/Express or Python Django that stores this data in a database. Or even Google Sheets or Airtable backing it, but likely a proper DB. If custom, we’d design a database schema similar to above. The backend would expose RESTful or GraphQL APIs (e.g., /api/articles, /api/projects etc.) that the front-end can call.
A Headless CMS: like Contentful, Strapi, Sanity, etc. This might accelerate development. For instance, Strapi could easily model these content types and provide an API and admin UI to edit them. Sanity as well with a bit of config. This way, non-developers (or Matt himself) could update content through a friendly interface. Headless CMS often support webhooks on publish (which can tie into our integration plans).
We should also consider if the site is statically built (like Next.js getStaticProps) or server-rendered. A static approach with incremental builds could be fine (Contentful/Sanity can trigger rebuilds), but with the dynamic elements (like posts pushing updates to site), maybe serverless API routes or SSR might be in play. Regardless, the content model stands.
Dynamic Content Use Cases: With the model in place, we can do cool things like:
Show the latest article title automatically in the homepage hero or elsewhere (pull from Articles sorted by date).
When Matt adds a new project and marks it as a “highlight”, it could automatically appear in the homepage projects section.
Populate the “related articles” in Services via tag matching or manually linking in the model (e.g., an article has a field linking it to a service).
Easily generate lists like “Recent 3 articles” or filter projects by a tag via API queries.
OAuth Integrations (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.): Including OAuth in the backend suggests we might allow Matt to authenticate the site to his social accounts. Possible uses:
Pulling in social posts: e.g., show his latest tweet or LinkedIn post on the site (like a “recent activity” widget). With API keys, we could fetch and display a feed snippet in the hero or footer. However, we must design carefully to not slow the site; maybe cache it.
Enabling one-click share: For instance, a reader could click a button to share an article on Twitter/LinkedIn; but OAuth isn’t needed for basic share links (only if posting as Matt automatically).
Allowing sign-in: Perhaps not needed, since it’s a personal site, not a user platform.
More likely, Matt might want to, from his admin interface, cross-post updates. Or maybe auto-post new articles to social. With OAuth tokens stored securely, when a new article is published, the backend could call Twitter/LinkedIn APIs to share a snippet (like “New blog post: {title} {link}”).
We can integrate libraries or use existing automation for that. But since they specifically mentioned OAuth, I suspect they want to incorporate dynamic content retrieval (like showing LinkedIn articles or tweets).
Implementation: We can set up something like NextAuth or custom OAuth flows to get tokens. But possibly simpler: rely on third-party integration (like Zapier/Make which we also mention). However, having Twitter’s API integrated might be tricky given new API rules, but maybe just a feed widget works.
Webhooks for Outbound Integrations (Make.com, n8n): This implies when certain events happen on the site, we want to trigger actions in external automation services. Potential events:
New contact form submission → send to Make.com or Zapier to, say, add to a Google Sheet or send an email notification or add to a CRM.
New article published → trigger an automation scenario (for social posts, email newsletter, etc.).
New project added or updated → maybe ping an update somewhere (like a portfolio aggregator?).
We will incorporate a webhook module in the backend: e.g., after saving content, do an HTTP POST to configured webhook URLs with some payload (Make.com and n8n are platforms where you can create custom workflows that start with a webhook trigger).
We’ll make this configurable so Matt can add webhook URLs for different event types. Security: possibly include a secret or use unique URLs. The user specifically mentioned managing outbound webhooks, so likely they want the ability to configure and trigger them easily in the system.
Incoming Update API (Changelogs from apps): This is an interesting requirement. It suggests that Matt might have external apps or products that should send updates into this website – possibly to publish a changelog or update feed.
For instance, if Matt has a SaaS product, and that product on deployment could call mbernier.com/api/changelog?api_key=XYZ with a message, to create a new entry on a changelog page.
Or maybe if he uses a third-party app that sends updates, the site can catch them.
We will support this by creating an authenticated endpoint (maybe a REST endpoint or even just reusing webhooks concept) where external sources can POST data (with a secret API key for authentication) to create or update content. For example, an endpoint /api/new-update that expects a JSON payload like { title, description, productId } and a key, then the backend creates a new entry in a “Updates” collection or so.
Alternatively, if it’s specifically for changelogs, we could have an Updates/Changelog content type with fields (date, text, maybe related project/app).
The key will be to ensure these keys are secure (we don’t want random people hitting it). Possibly each app gets a unique key or token.
We’ll also design how these updates are displayed – maybe as part of Projects (like each project could have a list of updates). Or perhaps an aggregated “Latest Updates” page. Since it’s mentioned in backend context, I suspect the idea is to automate adding content rather than doing manually.
Content Creation Hooks (AI integration): When adding new content through the CMS or backend, we want to have “hooks” that help with linking suggestions, tag generation, etc. Concretely:
When an article is saved, the system could automatically suggest tags by analyzing the text (using an AI model or an NLP library). For instance, call OpenAI with “suggest 5 tags for this text” and return those to the admin UI for acceptance
medium.com
.
Similarly, when writing an article or project description, the system could cross-reference existing services or articles and suggest “You mentioned ‘roadmap’, consider linking to your Fractional PM service” etc. This could be done by a simple keyword match (list of service keywords) or via an AI that summarizes and finds related content.
Another hook: when creating a project, suggest related blog posts by matching topics (perhaps based on tags or title keywords).
These “hooks” aren’t necessarily user-visible on the front-end, but they make the content management smarter and ensure the site is well interconnected without a ton of manual effort.
Implementation wise, we could have a backend module using OpenAI API for tag suggestions. Or use something like Google NLP for entity extraction.
Also an AI could help with writing meta descriptions or summaries – e.g., after writing a long article, click a button “Generate summary”, which uses AI to produce a 2 sentence summary for the description field.
We must integrate this carefully and keep it optional (the user can choose to use or ignore suggestions). But it’s a forward-thinking feature that adds technical impressiveness to the site’s backend.
Technology Stack Consideration: The plan seems to lean towards building a custom Node/Next.js backend with perhaps a database (like PostgreSQL or Mongo) to store all this content, or using a headless CMS which gives a lot out-of-the-box (with plugins for webhooks, user auth, etc.). If Matt is comfortable coding, a custom solution might be appealing to fully control it. Given the mention of LLMs.txt and such, a custom-coded approach might be expected because it’s a newer concept not yet standard in CMS platforms. Perhaps a hybrid: use a CMS like Strapi which is open-source and extendable – we can custom code the AI suggestion logic into it as needed.
APIs for Front-End: The site front-end will retrieve data via APIs or build-time queries. For example:
Home page will call /api/articles?limit=3 to get latest articles, /api/projects?highlight=true&limit=3 for featured projects, /api/social?latest=tweet for recent tweet if needed.
Articles page calls /api/articles?all or maybe we prerender with static props if not too large.
Projects page similarly via API.
Services page might fetch from /api/services (which includes maybe the text and any dynamic bits like testimonials).
Contact form submission likely posts to an API endpoint which then triggers an email or stores in DB + triggers webhook.
The links page calls /api/offers with maybe filter param if we implement that dynamically (or we can fetch all and filter client side).
Security: we’ll ensure any management endpoints (like the incoming API keys or admin editing) are protected (the admin interface likely separate or behind auth). Performance: using a CDN or static generation for public content pages ensures fast load, while dynamic portions (like latest tweet) can be loaded asynchronously. To sum up, our content/back-end strategy is to create a modular, API-driven system where all site content is structured and maintainable:
It empowers Matt to easily add/update content (through either a nice CMS UI or a minimal admin page), which then automatically reflects on the site in the right places.
It automates tedious tasks (like generating lists, linking content, posting updates) to keep the site fresh with minimal manual work.
It integrates with external services (social platforms, automation tools) to streamline marketing workflows (e.g., publish once, share everywhere).
It adds a layer of intelligence (AI-driven suggestions) to keep the site at the cutting edge and reduce the mental load on Matt for content optimization.
This robust backend is part of making the site “technically impressive” – not just a static site, but a smart system that showcases Matt’s tech savvy. It’s like under the hood of the business card, there’s a powerful engine. And importantly, this setup will scale: as Matt produces more content or new sections (say he starts a podcast or something), we can add a content type and display it without redoing the whole site structure. Finally, by implementing dynamic generation of files like LLMs.txt
medium.com
, we ensure the site is future-proof for AI indexing – which is a novel technical touch that many sites won’t have yet, showing Matt is ahead of the curve.
Technical Enhancements & AI Integration
Beyond the core content, we want to implement various technical features that showcase innovation and provide a smoother experience for both Matt and the site’s users. Some of these we touched on, but let’s enumerate the key technical enhancements and AI touchpoints and how they’ll be realized:
Dynamic LLMs.txt Generation: As mentioned, we will programmatically generate an /llms.txt file at the root of the website. This file will be a concise guide to the site’s content, intended for Large Language Models (LLMs) or AI agents that crawl the site
mintlify.com
. For example, it may list:
bash
Copy
Edit
# Site Overview for LLMs
/ - Homepage: Introduction and latest content highlights.
/services - Overview of consulting services (Fractional PM, Technical Consulting).
/articles - Index of all blog articles on product management, tech, AI, etc.
/articles/article-title-xyz - Article: "Title" - an article about ... (summary).
/projects - Portfolio of projects Matt has worked on.
/credentialing - Matt's work history and credentials.
/links - Curated list of recommended tools and resources.
Essentially, it will list all important pages with a brief description in Markdown format (per the llms.txt proposal, it’s usually a markdown outline of content)
medium.com
. Whenever content changes (new article or project), this file will update (which can be done on build or via an API call to regenerate). This helps AI systems answer questions about Matt or find his content more easily, which is forward-thinking as LLMs become a way people query info. We’ll ensure the site’s generator includes this and that it’s linked in robots.txt so bots know to find it.
Sitemap and SEO: We will generate a complete sitemap.xml using all content from the database (articles, projects, pages). The sitemap ensures search engines can index the site fully, which is standard but essential. robots.txt will reference the sitemap and also explicitly allow all (unless any admin or test paths exist, which we’d disallow accordingly). This area isn’t glamorous but it’s part of the backend tasks we won’t forget (and likely automated via our static site generator or CMS plugin).
OAuth Social Integrations: We’ll integrate with Twitter, LinkedIn, and possibly others (GitHub if needed, etc.) using OAuth. Concretely:
We will set up an app for Twitter and LinkedIn to get API keys. In the backend, we’ll store tokens securely.
We might add a section in the CMS for “Social Accounts” where Matt can connect/disconnect accounts. Once connected, our site can perform certain actions:
Display Social Content: For example, fetch the latest Tweet to display on the homepage (“As of [date], Matt tweeted: ...”) with a link to his Twitter. Or show the number of LinkedIn followers or something for social proof. But more useful might be a feed or a “Latest activity” widget combining sources.
Auto-Share Content: When a new article is published, the system could use the Twitter API to tweet a formatted message (title, link, maybe some hashtags). Similarly for LinkedIn, create a post. This can often be done via a single API call if credentials are stored. This saves Matt from manual posting and ensures timely announcement of new content. (We’ll provide toggles – maybe he can choose per article if it should auto-share or not.)
LinkedIn integration: Perhaps pulling in the latest LinkedIn article if he writes there, or allowing one-click share to LinkedIn for visitors. Possibly also verifying his credentials by linking to LinkedIn (but that’s less of an integration).
These integrations underscore that the site is not an isolated island; it’s part of Matt’s broader digital presence. The tech impressiveness comes from not just linking icons, but actually syncing content.
Webhook Management: We will create a small interface (or config file) for outgoing webhooks. This could be as simple as storing a list of webhook endpoints (URLs) with a label and specifying which event triggers each. For example:
“On New Article Published” -> call Make.com webhook at https://hooks.make.com/abc...
“On Contact Form Submission” -> call n8n webhook at https://n8n.app/webhook...
Possibly "On New Project" or "On New Offer Added" if needed.
Each webhook call will include a JSON payload with relevant data (e.g., article title, URL, summary for a new article; or form fields for contact). This allows immense flexibility: Matt can automate tasks outside the site. For instance, a Make.com scenario might take a contact submission and create a Trello card or send a Slack message to Matt. Using no-code tools like Zapier/Make is easier than coding every integration, so providing the hooks empowers Matt to connect to anything supported by those platforms. We’ll ensure these are secure (maybe include a secret in the payload or in the URL). We should also implement some form of logging or retry for webhooks (to handle if a webhook endpoint is down), or at least make them fire asynchronously so the user isn’t waiting on, say, the contact form to finish sending to all webhooks. We could queue them in the backend if needed or use background functions.
Incoming API for External Updates: As discussed, we’ll set up API endpoints protected by API keys that external apps or scripts can call. For example, POST /api/changelog with JSON {key: 'XYZ', product: 'MySaaS', update: 'Fixed bug in integration', date: '2025-07-05'} would, if key matches what’s on record for product "MySaaS", create a new entry in an Updates database. We might map product to a Project or to a dedicated product collection. This could then display on a “Updates” section of Matt’s site (if we make one) or perhaps on the project’s detail section if that product corresponds to a project. Essentially, it allows automated content injection from outside. We will maintain a list of valid API keys in the backend (each associated with some permission or specific content type allowed). These should be high-entropy strings (e.g., GUIDs or similar) so they can’t be guessed. We can also restrict by IP if needed for extra security. A use-case scenario: Suppose Matt has a side project app that has its own update feed. Instead of manually duplicating those updates on his site, the app on deployment calls the site’s API and voila, the update appears on his site’s “News” or on the project page. This keeps his site as the unified hub of all his work.
AI-Assisted Content Management:
Auto Tagging: When Matt adds a new article in the CMS, we’ll have an option “Suggest Tags”. Clicking it will send the content to an AI service (OpenAI GPT-4 or similar) with a prompt to extract 5 relevant tags (short phrases). The returned tags can be shown for approval, and then saved as the article’s tags if chosen. This saves time and might surface non-obvious tags.
Link Suggestions: On saving an article or project description, our system can scan the text for keywords matching names of other content (e.g., service names or other article titles). For each match, it could automatically insert a hyperlink or at least suggest “You mentioned 'roadmap', consider linking to your article on roadmaps”. Perhaps in the CMS UI, it highlights words that have link suggestions. Implementation might use a simple dictionary of internal keywords. Or more advanced, an AI that reads the piece and says “This article talks about agile sprints, you have another post about retrospectives – those are related.” If using AI, it could output likely related content from a list (we can feed it titles of all articles and see if it connects them).
AI Content Hooks: We could integrate GPT to generate meta descriptions, or even to generate a draft from bullet points (if Matt wanted to, say, quickly create a skeleton by AI and then edit). But that might be beyond scope; we focus on tags/links which were specifically mentioned.
AI for images or text improvements: Possibly not needed now, but architecture-wise, we could include an AI service that e.g. generates a summary of a lengthy case study to put as excerpt.
TailwindCSS Component Library: On a technical front-end note, we will likely create a set of reusable components with Tailwind (either manually or using a library like Tailwind UI/Flowbite for base styles). This means things like:
A <Button> component that already has the classes for primary button style (so using it everywhere ensures consistency in look and behavior).
A <Card> component for article/project listings with appropriate classes and slots for content.
A <Tag> component for pills.
A <Navbar> and <Footer> built with consistent Tailwind classes (and possibly using Headless UI or similar for mobile menu behavior).
Using these components not only speeds development but also ensures if we tweak a style in one place, it updates everywhere it’s used, maintaining consistency.
We might also utilize Tailwind plugins or config to define some common styles. For instance, define theme colors (brandPrimary, brandSecondary), maybe define a boxShadow in config that we use for all cards, etc.
Performance and Advanced UX:
We will optimize images (serve different sizes via <img srcset> or if using Next.js, <Image> component for auto optimization).
We could implement lazy loading for images in articles or projects so that the initial page load is faster.
For the articles index, instead of classic pagination, we might consider infinite scroll or “Load more” (this depends on preference; some users like clicking pages, some like scrolling – we can decide, but a visually nice pagination was specifically asked for, so likely pages).
Perhaps use caching or static generation where possible, with incremental updates when content changes (especially if using Next.js getStaticProps with revalidation).
We will test on multiple devices/browsers to ensure the Tailwind responsive design works as intended (Tailwind makes it straightforward to adjust layout on sm/md/lg breakpoints).
Analytics and Monitoring: Not explicitly mentioned, but since it’s a comprehensive overhaul, we might integrate Google Analytics or a privacy-friendly alternative so Matt can see traffic. Also, setting up a contact form spam filter (Akismet or reCAPTCHA) if spam becomes an issue. Given the technical bent, maybe implementing hCaptcha or a custom honeypot field to catch bots.
In summary, these technical enhancements ensure the site isn’t just a static brochure, but a living, integrated platform:
Content is easy to manage through a structured backend.
Site updates propagate to social media and vice versa with minimal effort.
Automation handles repetitive tasks (posting updates, notifying Matt or others).
AI is leveraged to improve content quality and site maintenance, keeping things cutting-edge.
Tailwind and modern frameworks keep the implementation efficient and consistent (and easily maintainable in code).
All this will make the site feel modern (to users, through interactivity and currency of content) and also be modern under the hood (to Matt/admin, through an intelligent CMS). It’s the kind of technical impressiveness that may not be visible at first glance, but over time results in a site that’s always up-to-date, well-linked, and actively engaging with other platforms – essentially functioning as the hub of Matt’s professional digital life.
Tone & Content Strategy
While much of the focus is on design and technical structure, it’s crucial to maintain and leverage Matt’s existing content tone and to shape the content strategy such that all parts of the site work in harmony. Matt’s writing voice is described as authentic, technical, clear, with bits of humor and directness – this is a strong asset as it differentiates his content from generic corporate fluff. We will ensure the tone remains consistent across new and existing content, and that we use content placement (cross-linking) strategically to tie the site together.
Maintain Authentic, Clear Voice: All new copy we add (e.g., on the Services page, CTAs, etc.) will be written in a straightforward, personable tone that matches Matt’s blogging style. For instance, if Matt’s articles often include a witty aside or a bold opinion, we can mirror a hint of that in service descriptions (“I won’t promise to fix your company’s culture in one day, but I will get your product process on track.” – a bit of humor while making a point). The idea is that a visitor should feel the same “personality” when reading the services or homepage text as they do reading an article. This builds trust – it shows Matt is the same person throughout, not putting on a marketing facade. Research from consultant sites suggests not to shy from humor or a conversational tone, as it makes you stand out and seem more relatable
freelancecake.com
. We’ll implement that, keeping professionalism (we won’t overdo jokes on the Services page, but a light touch is good).
Cross-Link Articles and Services: A key content strategy is to make the articles support the services. Matt’s articles demonstrate his expertise; we need to channel readers of those articles toward realizing “Hey, I could hire Matt to help me with this problem.” Conversely, someone reading about services may want to validate Matt’s expertise – articles can serve as proof. So, we will robustly interlink them:
On each relevant article, especially if it aligns with a service offering, we will include a line or CTA to the service. For example, an article about “How to Prioritize a Product Roadmap” directly relates to Fractional Product Management service. At the end of that article, we put: “Need help with product strategy? Learn about my Fractional Product Management services where I help companies prioritize and execute on their roadmaps.” – with a link. This way, a reader who found the article via Google now is one click from seeing the service page. If they enjoyed the content, they’ll be more likely to consider the service.
On the Services page (and possibly in a modal as we plan), we include related articles links. For Fractional PM, maybe list 2-3 blog posts dealing with product management leadership, with brief titles or even a snippet in a modal. This shows, Matt doesn’t just claim expertise – he writes about these topics in depth. It’s a gentle way to showcase authority. The Rattleback article suggested including relevant thought leadership content on service pages to help vetting prospects
rattleback.com
, which we’re doing via the modal or links.
Even on the Projects page or in project detail, if a project relates to a service, mention it (e.g., “This project was a technical consulting engagement – see Services -> Technical Consulting for what I offer.”).
Within articles, if context permits, we might also cross-link between articles (normal practice for blogs) or to projects (e.g., “When I built XYZ (see Projects), I encountered this problem…”). But doing too much might be distracting; we’ll do it where it naturally fits.
The content model’s linking fields will help manage these relationships so we don’t miss opportunities.
Homepage Content Balance: We noted that articles should not dominate the homepage. That is, the homepage should emphasize who Matt is and what he offers (services) more so than just being a blog listing. Currently, it has both, but we will shrink the article listing and make the Services section pop more. The tone of the homepage will be welcoming and oriented towards “Hi, I can help you, here’s how – also check out my insights.” This aligns with the goal that the articles support services, not overshadow them. We’ll feature perhaps just the latest 2-3 articles and 2-3 projects to show he’s active, but not list 10 of them which could push the services info far down.
Content Mix and Frequency: Although not explicitly asked, part of content strategy could be ensuring a good mix of topics in articles (Matt likely has that covered given his varied interests). The site can highlight categories so readers can find areas relevant to them (like separate feeds for AI, product management, etc.). We will set up filtering accordingly. Also, if Matt starts writing more about AI (just a guess from mention of AI tools and integration), we ensure those articles link to consulting in AI workflows.
Use of Humor and Directness: We want to preserve that “moments of humor and directness” as a hallmark. For example, Matt has an article titled “The Art of Disagree and Commit is crap without follow up” (seen in screenshot) – that kind of bold title shows personality. We should not shy away from similar flavor in site copy where appropriate. For instance, maybe a line in his credentialing story: “I learned early on that buzzwords don’t ship products – execution does.” – a direct statement that matches the candid tone. Or a bit of tongue-in-cheek in the links page like, “No, I’m not paid by Slack to list them here – I just really find it useful.” (if true). By doing so, the site will feel genuine. Authenticity is key to trust; as one consultant site takeaway said, “Don’t pretend to be someone you’re not... Do pretend to be who you’re becoming.”
freelancecake.com
 – essentially, be authentic. We’ll keep Matt’s authenticity front and center.
Content to Support Credibility: We will use content in service of building trust:
Case studies or detailed project write-ups: If possible, adding 1-2 case studies as blog posts or on projects page would be great. But if not in scope, the articles and project descriptions themselves serve as case studies.
Public speaking or media: If Matt does talks or has notable appearances, we might include a line or page about that (maybe not requested, but could be part of “Credentialing” or as external links). Even a line like “Matt has spoken at XYZ Conference on these topics” can add credibility. We could incorporate that into narrative if applicable.
Maintaining consistency in bio info: The tagline “Fractional Product Management Leader, Developer, writer, and creator” should resonate throughout. We’ll ensure subpages (like about/credential) echo that language, so there’s a unified message of what Matt’s identity and focus are.
Frequency of Updates & Signals of Activity: The strategy should consider that regular content updates (articles, etc.) keep the site fresh. It appears Matt is writing (there’s mention of May 2025 article in screenshot). We will make it easy to add content, which should encourage continued posting. Also, we might include subtle signals on site of recency – e.g., in the hero “Latest article on May 18, 2025” or in the credentialing “updated July 2025”. These small timestamps show visitors that the site is actively maintained, which improves trust (few things are worse than a personal site that looks abandoned). Because the user specifically wants a technically impressive hub, showcasing that it’s up-to-date is important.
Newsletter or Content Reuse: Not explicitly mentioned, but often content strategy includes capturing leads (like a newsletter signup). If Matt has or wants a newsletter, we could integrate that (embedding a signup form in the blog or links page: “Get my monthly insights directly to your inbox”). If not now, maybe plan for it. Also, reuse content by maybe summarizing blog posts on LinkedIn (which can be automated via our integration) – we’ve covered that in technical side.
Quality over Quantity: Another strategy point: ensure each piece of content on the site is high-quality and relevant. If some old posts are off-brand or not helpful, consider archiving them or updating. Since our focus is design strategy, we assume content is fine, but it might be worth auditing to see if any content doesn’t fit the new positioning. For example, if Matt had a very casual hackathon post that doesn’t tie to his services or brand, maybe it’s okay, but perhaps categorize it separately (like on articles page have filters or separation: professional insights vs. personal musings). But likely all content is relevant since it’s his professional site.
SEO and Tone: Using the authentic tone should also naturally include the right keywords (since he’s being direct on topics). We’ll just ensure headings and meta tags align to likely search queries (e.g., services page should mention “Fractional Product Manager” etc., which it will). The structure and cross-linking also helps SEO (internal links with keywords are good for search ranking of those pages).
Monitor and Iterate: Content strategy is ongoing. With the backend in place, Matt can easily add a new service offering or new content type if needed. For example, if he starts offering Workshops, we could add that to Services and put a banner “New: Hands-on Workshop Available”. The site will be flexible enough to handle expansion.
In essence, every piece of content has a job:
The hero and about info establish who Matt is and what he does (first impression, brand).
The articles demonstrate his expertise and bring in audience (via sharing or search), and then funnel interest to services.
The projects showcase results and capabilities, reinforcing trust and giving concrete examples (which can also interest potential clients).
The credentialing page underpins everything with the story and proof of experience, for those who need convincing.
The services page converts interest to action by clearly stating value and inviting contact.
The links/resources page provides value and perhaps SEO juice (if others link to his recommended tools page) and also subtly shows he’s plugged into industry tools.
The contact page captures the leads when they’re ready.
All these must speak in a consistent voice: Matt’s voice – knowledgeable but approachable. By weaving humor in sparingly and using direct language (avoiding buzzword soup), we make the content memorable. One of the consultant site tips: a conversational tone and even coining your own distinctive phrases can differentiate you

. Matt already does some of that with strong opinions. We will ensure the new content (like marketing copy) doesn’t water that down. Finally, we’ll keep an eye on not letting the blog section overwhelm: so homepage as discussed will limit it, and the main nav might not list dozens of categories (just “Articles” broadly). We rely on the filters on the articles page for deeper dives. By aligning design and technical changes with this content strategy, the website will function effectively: it will attract visitors (with valuable content), impress them (with professional design and credible info), and convert them (with clear offerings and CTAs), all while feeling like a coherent personal brand presence. The tone assures that even as the site gets more sophisticated in features, it still feels like Matt at the core – which is critical for a personal hub site.
Conclusion & Next Steps (Deliverables)
To summarize the comprehensive overhaul strategy: Style & Design System: We will introduce a warmer, more engaging visual design using a refined color palette and approachable typography. The site will feature consistent TailwindCSS-based components – from cards to buttons – ensuring a cohesive look across every page. We will reduce unnecessary whitespace to improve content density without sacrificing clarity, achieving a balanced, polished aesthetic that signals quality and trustworthiness from the first glance

uxpin.com
. The overall feel will be friendly and personal yet highly professional, aligning with Matt’s brand. Homepage: The redesigned homepage will immediately communicate Matt’s value proposition (clear hero headline and subtext)
freelancecake.com
, enhanced by dynamic content such as the latest article or project highlight. The hero section will be interactive (e.g., rotating recent updates or a subtle animation) to catch attention. We’ll showcase recent articles and projects in a more compact format, allowing room to prominently feature the Services preview section. The Services snippet will be visually distinct – possibly with background shading or an interactive element – and will include a few key benefits or trust signals to entice clicks
freelancecake.com
. We’ll either revamp or remove the Tools & Resources teaser to keep focus. Overall, the homepage will act as a friendly dashboard of Matt’s offerings and content – inviting users to explore further or get in touch, with clear CTAs (e.g., “Hire Me” and “See Services”) placed strategically. Articles (Blog) Page: We will streamline the blog index by removing the clutter of excessive tag pills. Instead, a clean filter mechanism will allow topic browsing without overwhelming the interface. Article preview cards will be standardized in appearance (same as homepage style) for a uniform user experience. We’ll implement a user-friendly pagination or “load more” system with Tailwind styling to encourage browsing
uxpin.com
. These changes put the focus on article titles and summaries, making it easier for readers to find interesting content. Each article page will be outfitted with an end-of-post CTA referencing relevant services (e.g., a prompt to contact Matt for help on the article’s topic), harnessing the content to support lead generation. Projects Page: The projects portfolio will be presented in a neat grid of project cards, each with an image (or a nice fallback if an image is missing) to maintain a polished look. We’ll create a default placeholder image style so that projects without custom visuals still appear complete and appealing. Topic or tech tags associated with projects will be styled consistently with the new tag design, and possibly a filter by project type will be added for ease of navigation. Pagination (if needed) will mirror the style used on the Articles page, providing a coherent browsing experience. These changes ensure the Projects page effectively showcases Matt’s work, underscoring outcomes and relevant skills, while also linking to services or articles where applicable (for example, a project that involved AI integration might link to an article Matt wrote on that subject or highlight that it’s part of his consulting domain). Work/Credentialing Page: Rebranded as “Credentialing,” this page will be refocused into a compelling narrative of Matt’s professional journey and achievements. Instead of a sterile resume list, we’ll craft a story-driven summary that highlights key roles and accomplishments, demonstrating growth and impact (e.g., how Matt’s leadership at past companies led to specific results). We’ll incorporate visual elements like company logos of significant past employers/clients
freelancecake.com
 and possibly a timeline or milestone format for readability. This page will be moved to the footer (no longer top-nav) to keep the primary navigation customer-centric, but it will serve as rich supporting material for those who seek it. We’ll ensure to connect the dots to current services – explicitly linking experiences to the expertise offered through Matt’s services. The result will be an “about” page that sells – instilling confidence through a mix of factual credentials and narrative, rather than just a raw list of jobs. Services Page: This is a major focal point of the overhaul. The new Services page will clearly delineate Matt’s two main offerings: Fractional Product Management and Technical Consulting. Each will have its own section with a concise overview following a problem-solution-benefit narrative
rattleback.com
 that speaks directly to client needs. We’ll bolster each section with supporting details: bullet points of what’s included, real-world outcomes to expect, and any available testimonials (client quotes) to provide social proof
freelancecake.com
. The design will use engaging elements – perhaps icons or illustrations – to differentiate the two services while maintaining a cohesive style. Trust signals (like years of experience, notable client names, etc.) will be woven in. Multiple CTA buttons (“Contact for Product Management”, “Contact for Consulting”) will be placed after each section and at the page end, making it easy for a motivated prospect to take the next step. The tone will be confident and clear, establishing Matt’s value proposition in each lane without jargon. By structuring the page content logically (overview, proof, CTA)
rattleback.com
 and designing it appealingly, we aim to convert more visitors into inquiries. Contact Page & CTAs: The contact page will be refreshed to be more inviting and user-friendly. Following the provided design cues, we’ll style the form with a modern, clean look – using Tailwind to ensure inputs, labels, and the submit button align with the site’s overall aesthetics. A brief intro on the contact page will set expectations and add a personal touch (“Drop me a note and I’ll reply within 24 hours” sort of message). We’ll implement any example styles from the screenshots, such as perhaps a two-column layout or a colored background section, to elevate the bland default form. Furthermore, CTAs prompting contact will be embedded throughout the site: at the bottom of articles, on project pages, and especially on the Services page, as described. These will take the form of short, relevant pitches with a link to the contact page. For instance, after an article about tech automation, a subtle box could say “Looking to automate your processes? Let’s chat about a solution.” This strategy gently nudges users at the point of highest interest. All these CTAs will use a consistent style (perhaps a highlighted background with a bold call-to-action line) so users recognize it as an invitation no matter where they see it. The goal is to make contacting Matt a natural next step during the browsing experience. Links/Resources Page: The /links page will be transformed from a simple list into a vibrant resource hub. Each recommended tool or service will be displayed as a card with its logo, name, and a brief description explaining why it’s useful
nikolaibain.com
. We’ll introduce optional filtering by category/tag so users can sift through, say, “Development Tools” vs “Productivity” vs “Reading” etc., with ease
nikolaibain.com
. The design will embrace a slightly playful style – we might use colorful badges or icons for categories – to give this page a fun, exploratory feel in line with its content, but we’ll keep the layout structured and clean. We’ll also add context where needed (for example, if any link is sponsored or an affiliate, it will be noted in an understated way). By rebranding this as a resources page with context, it provides value to the user (they understand what each link is) and subtly reinforces Matt’s knowledge and generosity (he’s sharing tools he finds useful). It becomes a page people might bookmark or share, which also reflects well on Matt’s brand. Content Management Backend & Model: Under the hood, we’ll implement a robust content management solution. We’ll either build or configure a headless CMS to accommodate the content types we identified – Articles, Projects, Clients, Services, Offers (links), Testimonials, Work History. All content will be accessible via structured APIs. This means adding a new article or project in the backend will automatically populate the respective sections of the site (no more hard-coding). The backend will also handle generating ancillary files like llms.txt (for AI indexing)
medium.com
, sitemap.xml, and robots.txt, keeping them up-to-date as content changes. We’ll integrate OAuth with Twitter, LinkedIn, etc., enabling dynamic content sharing and retrieval – for example, automatically tweeting new posts or showing the latest tweet on the site. We’ll also implement webhooks so that key events (like a form submission or new content publish) can trigger workflows in external automation tools (Make.com, n8n), aligning with any of Matt’s broader marketing stack. Moreover, the backend will expose secure endpoints for incoming data, such as allowing Matt’s external apps to post updates (for a changelog or status feed) directly to his site using secret API keys. This makes the site a central hub that can both broadcast out (to socials, etc.) and receive information in. Throughout, we’ll include “smart” features in the CMS: for instance, automated tag suggestions for articles using AI, or prompts to link to related content, to ease content creation and encourage interlinking. All these backend enhancements ensure the site is not only modern now but also maintainable and extensible for the future. Matt will be able to keep the site updated without needing to fiddle with code, and new features (like adding a newsletter or a new section) can be integrated into this framework readily. Tailwind CSS Components: All UI elements will be built with TailwindCSS utility classes, potentially augmented by a component library for consistency. We’ll define custom Tailwind theme settings for the brand colors and fonts so that using a button class or card class automatically applies the right styles (consistent border-radius, shadows, etc.). For example, we might create a Tailwind component class (using @apply) for .btn-primary that all buttons use, meaning if we adjust the color or padding there, it updates site-wide. We’ll do similar for .card, .tag-pill, etc. This way, the design system is enforced in code. It also makes future design tweaks easier – want to change accent color or text size? one config change updates the whole site. We will document some of the key classes/components in case Matt or another developer continues to iterate on the design. The use of Tailwind will ensure a consistent UI and faster development since we can assemble pages from these pre-styled building blocks rather than writing custom CSS each time
tailwindcss.com
. Automation & Workflows: Finally, we’ll set up the automation hooks for content re-use and efficiency. For instance:
When an article is published, a webhook can notify an email marketing service to perhaps add it to a newsletter or trigger a LinkedIn post creation (if not handled via direct API).
The contact form will send an email to Matt and also ping maybe a Google Sheets or CRM via Zapier for record-keeping.
If Matt has a scheduling app (Calendly, etc.), we might integrate that on the Contact page as well for immediate action.
We will test these workflows to make sure data flows correctly (no missing fields, secure handling of any personal info).
The “hooks” in content creation (AI tag suggestions, etc.) will be tested for quality – we’ll fine-tune prompts to OpenAI if needed to get useful tag suggestions or link recommendations. This not only saves Matt time but also ensures his site stays well structured (SEO benefit from good tagging and internal links).
With all these pieces, the deliverables from this overhaul will be:
A fully redesigned website UI/UX, covering all main pages (Home, Articles, Projects, Credentialing, Services, Contact, Links) with a consistent, modern style and responsive design.
Page-by-page design specifications detailing the new layouts and components for each section as described.
An implemented content schema within a headless CMS or custom backend, accommodating all of Matt’s content with relationships (articles ↔ tags/categories, projects ↔ clients/services, etc.).
Integration of advanced features like dynamic content in hero, modal pop-ups for related content, and more, using Tailwind and possibly some JS for interactivity.
Technical integrations set up for social media OAuth, webhooks for external tools, and secure API endpoints for external content publishing.
Tailwind CSS component library or utility classes that define the visual identity (colors, typography, spacing rules) and can be reused for any new sections in the future.
Documentation or notes on how to use the new CMS (so Matt can add content), and how to manage things like the API keys or webhooks (so he can tweak his Make.com scenarios or add a new one if needed).
Testing and QA results ensuring the site works across major browsers and devices, and that all the contact points (forms, links, CTAs) function as intended.
By executing this strategy, mbernier.com will evolve into a cutting-edge personal professional hub: it will look impressive (with a friendly yet sleek design), feel trustworthy (with unified branding and ample proof of expertise), and operate powerfully (with a rich backend enabling dynamic content and integrations). In short, it will indeed serve as a modern “business card” on steroids – one that not only presents Matt’s info but actively markets his skills, engages his audience, and automates his digital presence. This overhaul sets the stage for Matt to confidently drive his consulting and content efforts through his website, with the flexibility to grow and adapt as his journey continues. With the strategy laid out, the next steps are design mockups and implementation – translating these plans into actual pages and functionality. Each element described will be built and iteratively refined with feedback, ensuring the final product meets the goals of being approachable, professional, balanced, and technically advanced. Through this comprehensive redesign and strategic content alignment, mbernier.com will not only reflect who Matt is and what he offers, but will also actively advance his goals by converting visitors into clients and followers. It will be a site that Matt can be proud of and one that clients (and even other developers) will find memorable and impressive – truly fulfilling the project brief. Sources:
