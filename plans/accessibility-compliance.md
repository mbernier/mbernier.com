# Accessibility Compliance Plan

## Audit Summary

After analyzing the codebase, I've identified several accessibility gaps and areas for improvement. The application has some good accessibility practices in place but needs comprehensive enhancements to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ Good Practices Found
- Proper use of `aria-label` attributes on interactive elements
- Form labels are properly associated with inputs using `htmlFor`
- Error messages are properly associated with form fields using `aria-describedby`
- Theme toggle has appropriate ARIA labels
- Navigation has proper ARIA attributes for mobile menu
- Social links have descriptive labels

### ❌ Critical Issues Identified

#### 1. Missing Skip Links
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Issue**: No skip navigation links for keyboard users
- **Impact**: Keyboard users must tab through entire navigation to reach main content
- **Files Affected**: All page layouts

#### 2. Insufficient Color Contrast
- **Priority**: High
- **Issue**: Some text colors may not meet 4.5:1 contrast ratio requirements
- **Impact**: Users with low vision may struggle to read content
- **Files Affected**: CSS files, component styling

#### 3. Missing Focus Indicators
- **Priority**: High
- **Issue**: Focus states are not clearly visible on all interactive elements
- **Impact**: Keyboard users cannot determine which element has focus
- **Files Affected**: Button components, form inputs

#### 4. Missing Landmark Roles
- **Priority**: Moderate
- **Issue**: Some semantic HTML elements lack proper ARIA landmark roles
- **Impact**: Screen reader users may have difficulty navigating page structure
- **Files Affected**: Layout components

#### 5. Form Validation Accessibility
- **Priority**: Moderate
- **Issue**: Error states and validation feedback need better screen reader support
- **Impact**: Users with disabilities may miss important form feedback
- **Files Affected**: ContactForm.tsx

## Remediation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Add Skip Links
- [ ] Create skip link component
- [ ] Add to main layout
- [ ] Test with keyboard navigation

#### 1.2 Enhance Focus Management
- [ ] Improve focus indicators across all components
- [ ] Add focus trap for modals
- [ ] Ensure logical tab order

#### 1.3 Fix Color Contrast
- [ ] Audit all text colors against WCAG contrast requirements
- [ ] Update color palette to meet 4.5:1 ratio
- [ ] Test with color contrast tools

### Phase 2: Structural Improvements (Week 2)

#### 2.1 Add Semantic Landmarks
- [ ] Add `role="main"` to main content areas
- [ ] Add `role="navigation"` to navigation components
- [ ] Add `role="complementary"` to sidebars
- [ ] Add `role="contentinfo"` to footers

#### 2.2 Enhance Form Accessibility
- [ ] Add `aria-invalid` to form fields with errors
- [ ] Improve error message announcements
- [ ] Add `aria-required` to required fields
- [ ] Enhance form validation feedback

#### 2.3 Improve Image Accessibility
- [ ] Ensure all images have meaningful alt text
- [ ] Add `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative images
- [ ] Review image descriptions for context

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3)

#### 3.1 Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Test with screen readers

#### 3.2 ARIA Enhancements
- [ ] Add `aria-live` regions for dynamic content
- [ ] Implement proper heading hierarchy
- [ ] Add `aria-expanded` states where needed

#### 3.3 Testing and Validation
- [ ] Run automated accessibility tests
- [ ] Manual testing with screen readers
- [ ] Keyboard-only navigation testing
- [ ] Color contrast validation

## Component-Specific Fixes

### Button Component
- [ ] Add `aria-pressed` for toggle buttons
- [ ] Ensure proper focus styling
- [ ] Add loading state announcements

### Input Component
- [ ] Add `aria-describedby` for help text
- [ ] Improve error state styling
- [ ] Add `aria-invalid` attribute

### Navigation Components
- [ ] Add skip links
- [ ] Improve mobile menu accessibility
- [ ] Add proper ARIA landmarks

### Theme Toggle
- [ ] Add `aria-pressed` state
- [ ] Improve focus indicators
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing
- [ ] Install and configure `axe-core`
- [ ] Set up Lighthouse CI
- [ ] Add ESLint accessibility rules

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- [ ] Keyboard-only navigation
- [ ] High contrast mode testing
- [ ] Zoom testing (200%)

### User Testing
- [ ] Test with users who have disabilities
- [ ] Gather feedback on accessibility features
- [ ] Iterate based on user feedback

## Success Metrics

- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [ ] 100% keyboard navigation coverage
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Color contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1
- [ ] Zero critical accessibility violations

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Critical fixes (skip links, focus management, color contrast)
- **Week 2**: Structural improvements (landmarks, forms, images)
- **Week 3**: Advanced features and comprehensive testing
- **Week 4**: Documentation and training
