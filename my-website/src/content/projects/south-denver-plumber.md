SouthDenverPlumber.com is a modern, responsive website I built for Frank Santilli's plumbing business serving the South Denver metro area, including Highlands Ranch, Littleton, Lakewood, Centennial, and Lone Tree.

### The Business Challenge

Frank needed a professional online presence that would:

- Clearly showcase his plumbing services to potential customers
- Make it easy for clients to contact him for emergencies or bookings
- Build trust with potential customers through testimonials and service guarantees
- Rank well in local search results for the South Denver area

### What I Built

I developed a user-friendly website with a clean, professional design that reflects the reliability of Frank's services. The site includes:

- **Comprehensive Service Pages**  
  Detailed descriptions of all services including water heater repair, drain cleaning, residential and commercial plumbing services, emergency services, and preventative maintenance.

- **Optimized Contact Flow**  
  Prominent display of phone numbers and contact forms, making it simple for customers to reach out during plumbing emergencies.

- **Customer Testimonials**  
  A showcase of real customer experiences to build trust with potential clients.

- **Service Area Highlighting**  
  Clear information about the neighborhoods and areas Frank serves in South Denver.

- **Mobile-First Design**  
  Fully responsive interface that works perfectly on phones, tablets, and desktops - essential for customers who often need to find plumbing help while away from their computer.

### Technical Implementation

The website was built using:

- **React with TypeScript** for a maintainable, type-safe codebase
- **Vite** for fast build times and optimal performance
- **TailwindCSS** for responsive, custom styling
- **Framer Motion** for subtle animations that enhance the user experience
- **React Router** for client-side navigation
- **Custom SEO optimization** for local search performance

### Business Impact

The new website has helped Frank:

- Increase local visibility for his plumbing business
- Generate more direct inquiries through the website
- Streamline customer communication
- Present a professional image that stands out from competitors
- Build a foundation for future digital marketing efforts
