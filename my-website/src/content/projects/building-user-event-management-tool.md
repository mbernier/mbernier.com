I am using Python to build a system that will manage events around the world for a community building organization. It will allow:

- Users to sign up, refer friends, manage their profiles
- Admins to manage the locations of groups, the local managers, the events, and users
- Local Managers will be able to manage their location, their events, sponsors, and users
- Create Slack channels on demand as new groups or locations are created

This is to replace multiple spreadsheets, siloed information, and provide more organization for a large scale world-wide community building group.
