# Developer Experience Improvement at SendGrid

## Overview

At SendGrid, I focused on improving the developer experience through better SDK design, documentation, and developer-centric processes. The project aimed to increase SDK adoption rates and simplify the onboarding process for developers integrating with SendGrid's email services.

## Technologies Used

- API Design and Development
- SDK Architecture
- Technical Documentation
- Developer Relations
- Product Management

## My Role

As a Senior Product Manager, I:
- Led the initiative to improve SDK adoption rates across multiple programming languages
- Collaborated with engineering teams to prioritize developer-facing improvements
- Established metrics and tracking for developer success
- Built cross-functional collaboration between Engineering, Product, and Developer Relations

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the key challenges was balancing the needs of existing developers with the goal of simplifying the experience for new users. By implementing a product-led growth (PLG) approach, we were able to create a seamless onboarding process while maintaining the robust functionality needed by power users.

Another challenge was ensuring consistent experiences across multiple programming languages and frameworks. We developed standardized patterns and interfaces that could be implemented across different language SDKs.

## Outcomes

- SDK adoption rates outpaced company growth
- Improved developer onboarding experience with measurable reduction in support tickets
- Shifted product teams from reactive to proactive prioritization
- Enhanced API documentation and integration support
- Built stronger collaboration between Engineering, Product, and Developer Relations

This work contributed significantly to SendGrid's developer-focused reputation in the market and supported the company's growth strategy.
