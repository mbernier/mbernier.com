# AI Image Recognition Project

## Overview

I am working on building a software solution that utilizes the EfficientNet-B3 Model, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network for image recognition. The project focuses on training the model to recognize specific patterns within images to match them with product listings found online. This application has significant potential for e-commerce, inventory management, and competitive analysis use cases.

## Technologies Used

- Python for core development and model implementation
- EfficientNet-B3 neural network architecture
- Machine Learning frameworks (TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- Image analysis and computer vision techniques
- Data processing and augmentation pipelines

## My Role

As the creator and developer of this project at Bernier LLC, I am:

- Designing and implementing the core machine learning architecture
- Training the EfficientNet-B3 Model on custom datasets
- Developing pattern recognition algorithms for product matching
- Building the end-to-end pipeline from image input to product listing matches
- Testing and optimizing the model for accuracy and performance

## Challenges and Solutions

Working with image recognition for product matching presents several unique challenges:

- Variations in product photography styles and quality
- Handling different angles, lighting conditions, and backgrounds
- Ensuring high accuracy to make the matches commercially viable
- Optimizing the model to run efficiently with reasonable computational resources

To address these challenges, I'm implementing extensive data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness, using transfer learning to leverage pre-trained weights, and developing a custom similarity scoring system to improve match confidence.

## Outcomes

As this is an ongoing project (started March 2025), the key outcomes so far include:

- Successful proof of concept demonstrating pattern recognition capabilities
- Development of a training pipeline for the EfficientNet-B3 model
- Initial testing showing promising results for product matching accuracy
- Framework for integrating with e-commerce platforms for real-world application

The project continues to evolve as I refine the model and expand its capabilities for commercial applications.
