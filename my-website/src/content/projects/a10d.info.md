If you've ever wished you could easily reconnect with everyone you've met through your calendarâ€”**a10d.info** is a tool I built to make this dead simple.

This lightweight tool gives you the ability to upload your `.ics` calendar file and quickly extract a filtered list of meeting attendeesâ€”complete with their email addresses.

### Why I Built This

There were so many times I wanted to:

- Follow up with people Iâ€™d met in recent months.
- Create a small email update list without exporting my entire address book.
- Audit how I was spending my time and with whom.

Google Calendar doesnâ€™t make this easy out of the box. So I built something that does.

### What You Can Do with a10d.info

Once you upload your `.ics` file, you can:

- **Filter your results**  
  Choose your desired date range, cap the maximum number of attendees per meeting (to avoid pulling emails from giant webinars), and optionally limit to meetings you actually accepted.

- **Export attendees**  
  The tool compiles the filtered list of attendee emails across all matching meetings. You can export this to a CSV and use it for:

  - A lightweight mailing list
  - Re-engagement campaigns
  - Rebuilding your network from past activity

- **See your stats**  
  You'll get an analytics dashboard with insights like:
  - Total meetings during your selected time period
  - Unique attendees
  - Average attendees per meeting
  - Events you organized vs. attended
  - Your longest meeting
  - Most common meeting day
  - Meeting frequency over time

Hereâ€™s a sample stats dashboard from my own data:

### Built With

This project is powered by:

- **TypeScript + Vite** for the frontend
- **ical.js** for parsing calendar data
- **Vercel** for fast, free hosting
- A simple, clean interface that stays out of your way

### Try It Out

The site is free to use and doesnâ€™t store your calendar dataâ€”everything runs client-side during the file upload and processing phase.
