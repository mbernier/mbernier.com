# AI Text Processing Pipeline

## Overview

I'm developing an intelligent text processing solution that automates the extraction of valuable data from thousands of unstructured text files in the high-end luxury product market. Rather than crafting and maintaining custom parsers for each data source—a process that becomes unwieldy as sources evolve and formats vary—I've engineered a sophisticated prompt system that harnesses the power of ChatGPT to transform raw text into structured JSON data.

This approach offers remarkable adaptability in the face of inconsistent data sources and evolving formats, reducing both development overhead and maintenance complexity. By delegating the pattern recognition and extraction tasks to an LLM through carefully calibrated prompts, the system can identify and extract relevant information with minimal human intervention, saving days of work per data source.

## Technologies Used

- Python for application architecture and data orchestration
- ChatGPT API for natural language understanding and data extraction
- JSON for structured data representation
- Advanced caching strategies for parallel processing and API rate limit management
- Workflow pipeline architecture (similar to Temporal.io) for reliable processing
- Database technologies for persistent storage and retrieval
- Custom prompt engineering for reliable extraction patterns

## My Role

As the architect and lead developer of this project, I am:

- Designing the end-to-end data processing architecture
- Implementing robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Developing and refining the prompt engineering to ensure consistent extraction
- Creating validation systems to verify data quality and completeness
- Building scalable processes to handle growing volumes of text
- Optimizing parallel processing workflows with intelligent caching

## Challenges and Solutions

Working with AI-powered text extraction presents several interesting challenges:

- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting precise instructions that consistently yield the correct data structure across varied inputs
- **Model Variation Handling**: Building resilience against API and model changes over time
- **Inconsistent Source Data**: Implementing adaptive approaches to handle missing fields and format inconsistencies
- **Validation Mechanisms**: Cross-referencing data across multiple sources to ensure accuracy
- **Scale Processing**: Managing the extraction of data from 30+ distinct sources efficiently
- **Rate Limiting**: Implementing sophisticated caching to optimize API usage while maintaining throughput

## Project Scale

The initial phase of this project involves processing:

- Thousands of unique luxury products
- Approximately 20,000 product images
- Roughly 2,500 product listings
- Data from more than 30 distinct sources

The system is designed for continuous expansion, with plans to incorporate additional data sources and enhance existing product profiles over time.

## Outcomes

As an ongoing project (initiated in March 2025), the current achievements include:

- A functional data ingestion and processing pipeline
- Reliable JSON transformation of unstructured text
- Comprehensive product profiles that aggregate information across multiple sources
- Scalable database architecture for the processed data

## Next Milestones

Once the data extraction and structuring pipeline reaches production stability:

- Develop an intuitive front-end interface to visualize comprehensive product profiles
- Create systems to track product history, including previous listings and ownership changes
- Implement comprehensive user management with authentication
- Deploy flexible monetization options including subscription models and single-purchase access
- Add engagement features such as referral systems and promotional discounting
