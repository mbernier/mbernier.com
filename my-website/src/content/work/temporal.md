# Head of Product at Temporal

At Temporal.io, I focused on **product-led growth (PLG), developer experience, and driving revenue**. Major wins:

- Launched **self-service signups**, achieving a **14% conversion rate** within 3 months.
- Drove **over a billion user actions** within 6 months of self-signup going live.
- Built **cross-functional collaboration** between Product, Sales, and Engineering to scale adoption.
- Advocated for **better developer education & documentation** to lower friction in onboarding.
