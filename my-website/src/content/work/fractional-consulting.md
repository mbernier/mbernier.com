# Fractional Chief Product Officer (CPO)

As a **Fractional CPO**, I help **Series A-C startups** transition from **engineering-led** to **product-led growth**. Key areas of impact:

- Establishing **Product Management foundations** in early-stage startups.
- Optimizing **prioritization frameworks (e.g., RICE)** for better decision-making.
- Mentoring **new product managers** and hiring the right talent.
- Improving **cross-functional team collaboration** across Security, Sales, and Engineering.
