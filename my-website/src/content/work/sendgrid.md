# Senior Product Manager at SendGrid

At SendGrid, I focused on **developer experience, SDK adoption, and product-led growth (PLG)**. Key contributions:

- Improved **SDK adoption**, outpacing company growth by simplifying onboarding.
- Led initiatives to **shift product teams from reactive to proactive prioritization**.
- Enhanced **developer experience** through better API documentation and integration support.
- Built cross-functional collaboration between **Engineering, Product, and Developer Relations**.
