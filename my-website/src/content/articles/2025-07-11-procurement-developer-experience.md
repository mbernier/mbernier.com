Most product teams don’t think about procurement. They focus on shipping features, polishing documentation, and improving onboarding. And while those things matter a *lot*, they aren’t enough.

Because even if a developer *loves* your product—if your company makes it hard to get through **Legal, Privacy, Security, or Finance** approvals, you’re going to lose the deal.

That means *you’re* going to lose that developer.

### Developer experience doesn’t stop at “It works!”

If you want your API or SaaS product to get adopted inside engineering teams, you have to support the *whole journey*. That includes the part where the champion developer has to bring your tool to:

- A skeptical tech lead  
- A manager with budget constraints  
- A security team with risk standards  
- A finance team that wants predictability  
- A legal team that asks for contract changes  
- A privacy team that wants to know what data you touch

When product managers ignore this, deals fall apart. Even when the product is *great*.

### Developer trust depends on follow-through

If a developer gets excited about your tool—integrates it, builds a proof of concept, and shares it with their team—they’re taking a risk. They’re betting time, energy, and political capital that your product is a good call.

If your team ghosts the legal review or sends back a ridiculous redline…

If you can’t answer a basic SOC2 or HIPAA question…

If you refuse to share a pricing quote or insist on annual contracts with no transparency…

That developer looks *bad* for advocating you.

And next time? They won’t try.

### Procurement blockers destroy momentum

I’ve worked with teams across SendGrid, Twilio, mParticle, and Temporal, and I’ve seen how often deals get blocked—not because the tech is wrong, but because the process around it is broken.

Here’s how the anti-pattern unfolds:

- Dev finds your product and loves it  
- Builds a small proof of concept  
- Shares with their tech lead → gets a thumbs up  
- Brings to their manager → gets tentative budget approval  
- Procurement starts... and it all falls apart  

Maybe your team:
- Won’t answer questions  
- Takes weeks to respond  
- Refuses to make minor contract edits  
- Surprises the buyer with extra fees or legal clauses

Even if you fix things later—it’s *too late*. Trust is gone. Integration is paused. Teams are already exploring Plan B.

### Product managers need to own the full experience

If you’re a PM and you think, “That’s sales/finance/legal’s problem”—you’re wrong.

**It’s your product.**

That means it’s your responsibility to ensure that the *entire* experience of adopting it—evaluation, onboarding, integration, and procurement—is smooth.

Here’s how you can help:

#### 1. Partner with your legal and privacy teams
Understand what questions prospects ask. Build reusable responses (e.g., security whitepapers, DPA templates). Publish what you can.

#### 2. Add procurement to the developer journey
If you have a “Getting Started” guide or onboarding flow, include a section like:
> “Need help with legal/security reviews? Here’s how we help your team say yes.”

#### 3. Build a shared narrative with sales
Make sure sales, support, and product *all* understand what’s typical, what’s flexible, and how to respond when procurement questions come in.

#### 4. Write for the buyer, not just the builder
Engineers care about endpoints. Buyers care about vendor reliability, compliance, and long-term stability. Your product site should speak to *both*.

#### 5. Track where you lose deals—and why
If developers love your product but you're not growing, procurement may be the missing link. Run interviews and win/loss analysis.

### You can’t feature your way out of a broken process

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: **shipping features is not your whole job.**

The best APIs die on the vine because they’re too hard to *adopt inside a company*.

You need to support the people who want to say yes to you. That means making the legal, privacy, security, and finance experience:

- Predictable  
- Documented  
- Responsive  
- Reasonable

### Recap: What we’ve covered so far

This is Article 3 in a four-part series on Developer Experience.

1. In [Part 1](https://mbernier.com/2025-07-07-developer-experience-is-product-strategy), we discussed how onboarding, docs, and SDKs set the tone.  
2. In [Part 2](https://mbernier.com/2025-07-09-api-pricing-is-developer-experience), we explained why pricing is a core part of the developer journey.  
3. Now here in Part 3, we’re making it clear: Procurement can make or break adoption.
