Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that enables peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks. Key characteristics include:

- **Decentralization**: Operates on a distributed ledger called the blockchain, maintained by a network of nodes.

- **Limited Supply**: Capped at 21 million coins, introducing scarcity.

- **Transparency**: All transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain.

- **Anonymity**: Users can transact without revealing personal identities.

Bitcoin's value is subject to high volatility, influenced by market demand, regulatory news, and macroeconomic factors. It's essential to conduct thorough research before investing or using Bitcoin for transactions.
