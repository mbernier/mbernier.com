> **why this guide matters 💌**
>
> Names aren’t just labels—they’re shorthand for who we are. When someone changes theirs—whether after gender transition, a marriage, a cultural reclamation, a divorce, or simply growing into a truer identity—every instance of the old name can feel like a pinprick. An inbox is especially loaded:
>
> Dead‑naming hurts. For many trans and non‑binary folks, seeing a dead name in every thread is an involuntary reminder of a life they’ve moved beyond. It can trigger dysphoria, anxiety, or the dull ache of being mis‑seen.
> 
> Privacy & safety matter. Survivors of abuse, people who’ve left controlling relationships, or anyone escaping harassment may need to seal off old identifiers to stay secure.
> 
> Professional credibility follows suit. A fresh résumé or LinkedIn headline loses impact if outbound email still introduces you as “jane.smith” when you’re now “jay.solis.” Small mismatches can stall a job hunt or stall trust with clients.
> 
> Micro‑affirmations add up. Every time colleagues or friends use the correct address, they reinforce respect in the same way pronouncing someone’s name correctly does in conversation.
> 
> If you’re the person making the change, this guide walks you through it step by step so you aren’t stuck reliving the past one email at a time.
> 
> If you’re **a manager, IT admin, partner, or friend—** offer to tackle the technical lift. Updating an address is a practical act of solidarity: it shrinks daily friction, signals “I see you,” and lets people move through the digital world in the name that fits.
> 
> With that context, let’s dive into the how‑to.

## 1. Personal Gmail (@gmail.com)  

### 1 A. Create the new address  
1. Sign out (or open an Incognito window) and visit **gmail.com**.  
2. Click **Create account** → **For myself**.  
3. Choose a username that reflects your current name.  
4. Finish the sign‑up and turn on 2‑Step Verification.

### 1 B. Link the two accounts (so old mail keeps arriving)

You have two solid options. Pick one that feels easiest:

| Option | How it works | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **POP fetch (“Check mail from other accounts”)** | Your new inbox pulls mail from the old one every few minutes. | Central inbox; you can delete the old account later. | Needs POP enabled in the old account and an *app password* if 2‑Step Verification is on. |
| **Auto‑forwarding** | Old account pushes every new message to the new address instantly. | Faster delivery; simpler setup. | You still have two inboxes (old + new) unless you archive on arrival. |

**POP fetch setup** (5‑minute walk‑through)  
1. **In the *old* Gmail:**  
   * Settings → **Forwarding and POP/IMAP** → **Enable POP for all mail** → *Save*  
2. **In the *new* Gmail:**  
   * Settings → **Accounts and Import** → **Check mail from other accounts** → **Add a mail account**  
   * Enter the old address → **Next** → choose **Import using POP3**  
   * Provide the old account’s email + *app password*, port **995**, SSL **on**.  
   * Tick **Label incoming messages** (helps you see what’s still arriving).  
   * Finish and wait for the first import. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

**Auto‑forwarding setup**  
1. In the old Gmail: Settings → **Forwarding and POP/IMAP** → **Add a forwarding address**.  
2. Enter the new address, verify the confirmation code, then choose **Forward a copy** and decide whether to keep or archive old mail.

### 1 C. Decide how you *send* mail

1. In the new Gmail: Settings → **Accounts and Import** → **Send mail as** → **Add another address**.  
2. Enter the *old* address. Gmail sends a verification code to the old inbox (which now appears in the new account if you followed the steps above).  
3. After verification you can pick:  
   * **“Reply from the same address the message was sent to.”** People who wrote to your old address get replies that look seamless.  
   * Or set the new address as default and un‑tick “Treat as an alias” if you never want to show the old name again.

That’s it—you now receive and reply from a single inbox while sharing your new identity everywhere.

## 2. Google Workspace (business / custom domain)

> **You’ll need admin access.** If that’s not you, forward this section to your administrator.

### 2 A. Rename the user in the Admin console  

1. Sign in at **admin.google.com**.  
2. **Directory → Users** → search for the account.  
3. Click the user → **Update user** (pencil icon).  
4. Under **Primary email**, edit the username portion and **Save**.  
   * Workspace automatically turns the *old* address into an **alias**, so no messages go missing. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
   * The user keeps all Drive files, Calendar events, etc.; only the sign‑in name changes.

### 2 B. (Optional) Move to a different domain  
If you added a new last‑name domain (e.g., from `@old-co.com` to `@new-co.com`):

1. **Admin console → Account → Domains → Add a domain** (or domain alias) and verify DNS.  
2. Return to **Directory → Users**, open the profile, and next to **Primary email** choose the new domain from the drop‑down before saving.

### 2 C. Add or adjust aliases

Aliases let a person receive mail at multiple addresses **and** choose which one appears in “From”.

1. **Users → <username> → Add alternate emails** → enter any additional spellings (e.g., maiden@, nickname@). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
2. Within 15 minutes, those aliases appear in Gmail under **Settings → Accounts → Send mail as**, ready to pick when composing.  
   * Check **“Reply from the same address the message was sent to.”** if you want replies to match the incoming address.

### 2 D. Communicate the change internally  
* Post an announcement in Chat/Slack so colleagues update address books.  
* If the old address was public‑facing, add a Gmail **Vacation responder** (“I now use my newname@domain.com”) for 30–60 days.

## 3. Extra tips & safeguards

| Step | Why it helps |
| --- | --- |
| **Turn on 2‑Step Verification** for *all* accounts. | Stops unauthorized logins while you’re juggling credentials. |
| **Update critical logins** (banking, utilities, MFA apps) with the new address ASAP. | Prevents password‑reset loops going to the old inbox. |
| **Export a Google Takeout** archive of the old account. | Peace of mind if you decide to delete it later. |
| **Set calendar & Drive sharing defaults** to the new email. | Avoids “insufficient permission” errors for collaborators. |
| **Keep the old address active for at least 6 months**. | Gives partners and automated systems time to catch up. |
