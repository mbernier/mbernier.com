*Finally—a set of instructions that actually works.*

### Why bother?

If you keep your personal Gmail tab open all day but rarely check the Google Workspace mailbox your company gave you, you miss messages—or you burn time flipping between accounts. Unfortunately, most “how-to” articles leave out two critical requirements that make the connection fail in 2025:

1. **You must have 2-Step Verification turned on for the Workspace account.**
2. **You must use a 16-character App Password—*not* your normal sign-in password—to authenticate POP and SMTP.**

Follow the checklist below and you’ll have Workspace mail flowing into your personal inbox (and the ability to reply “from” your work address) in under ten minutes.

## Prerequisites

| What                                                                                            | Why                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Admin allows POP & IMAP** in Google Admin → Apps → Google Workspace → Gmail → End-User Access | POP fetching won’t work if the org disables it.                |
| **2-Step Verification enabled** on your Workspace account                                       | App Passwords only appear after 2-SV is on. ([Google Help][1]) |
| **A phone number or security key enrolled**                                                     | Needed to complete 2-SV prompts.                               |
| **Personal Gmail account ready**                                                                | That’s where the messages will land.                           |

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Turn on 2-Step Verification

1. Log in to **myaccount.google.com** with your *Workspace* account.
2. Navigate to **Security → 2-Step Verification** and follow the prompts.
3. Add at least one second factor (phone prompt, authenticator app, or FIDO key).

### 2. Generate an App Password

1. Still in **myaccount.google.com**, go to **Security → 2-Step Verification → App Passwords**.
2. Choose **“Mail”** as the app and **“Other (Custom name)”**—call it *“Personal Gmail POP/SMTP”*.
3. Copy the 16-character password Google shows you (no spaces).

*Keep this window open or paste the password in a temporary note—you’ll use it twice.*

([Google Help][2])

### 3. Fetch Workspace mail into Personal Gmail (POP)

1. Sign in to **your personal Gmail**.
2. Click the gear → **See all settings** → **Accounts & Import**.
3. Under **“Check mail from other accounts,”** choose **Add a mail account**.
4. Enter your Workspace address and choose **POP**. On the next dialog, fill in:

| Field                  | Value                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Username               | *your Workspace email*                                       |
| Password               | **App Password** you just created                            |
| POP Server             | **pop.gmail.com**                                            |
| Port                   | **995**                                                      |
| Leave a copy on server | **Unchecked** *(Google blocks the setup if you leave it on)* |
| Always use SSL         | **Checked**                                                  |

> **Need faster catching-up?** If Gmail seems to ignore new messages that arrived in the last 30 days, prefix the username with `recent:` (e.g., `recent:you@company.com`). ([Google Help][3])

5. Click **Add Account** → **Next** → **Yes, I want to be able to send mail as…**.

### 4. Send *from* your Workspace address (SMTP)

1. Still in the pop-up, Gmail asks for SMTP settings:

| Field              | Value                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| SMTP Server        | **smtp.gmail.com**               |
| Port               | **587 (TLS)** *(or 465 for SSL)* |
| Username           | *your Workspace email*           |
| Password           | **Same App Password**            |
| Secured connection | **TLS**                          |

2. Gmail sends a confirmation code to your Workspace mailbox; because POP is now active, it should appear in your personal inbox within a minute. Paste the code to verify.

([Google for Developers][4])

## Testing

1. Send a message from another email (or a testing tool) to your Workspace address—verify it lands in *Inbox → \[Workspace label]* inside personal Gmail.
2. Compose a new email in personal Gmail and choose the **From:** dropdown to select your Workspace identity—confirm recipients see the correct “sent-as” address.

## Troubleshooting FAQ

| Symptom                                    | Fix                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Authentication fails**                   | Double-check that you used the *App Password*, not your normal password, in both POP and SMTP screens.                               |
| **POP test passes but no mail arrives**    | In Workspace Gmail settings, ensure **POP is enabled** for *all* mail.                                                               |
| **Duplicate messages**                     | Keep “Leave a copy on the server” unchecked so Gmail tracks what it already fetched.                                                 |
| **Throttled fetching (only every 60 min)** | That’s a POP limitation. Consider filtering high-priority labels to forward instead.                                                 |
| **Security warning in Admin console**      | POP connections to `pop.gmail.com:995` are SSL-encrypted and comply with Google’s recommended settings. ([Google for Developers][4]) |

## Is POP the only option?

Gmail’s *Gmailify* feature adds IMAP-like perks (spam filtering, search) for a handful of external providers, but **Google-to-Google accounts aren’t eligible**, so POP+SMTP remains the simplest path today. ([The Verge][5])

---

## Key Takeaways

* **Enable 2-Step Verification → App Password → POP 995 → SMTP 587.**
* Use `pop.gmail.com` (not `imap.gmail.com`) for fetch.
* Remember to set up “Send mail as” so replies come from the right address.
* The whole flow is encrypted end-to-end (SSL/TLS), so it’s safe for production use.
