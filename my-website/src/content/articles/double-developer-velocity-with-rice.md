In today's fast-paced tech environment, increasing development velocity is crucial. However, expanding your team isn't always feasible. Here are strategies to double your development speed without adding more personnel:

1. **Implement Agile Methodologies**: Adopt frameworks like Scrum or Kanban to streamline workflows and enhance productivity.

2. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automate testing and deployment processes to reduce manual interventions and accelerate release cycles.

3. **Code Reviews and Pair Programming**: Encourage collaborative coding practices to improve code quality and knowledge sharing.

4. **Invest in Developer Tools**: Equip your team with the latest tools and technologies to simplify tasks and reduce development time.

By focusing on these areas, you can significantly boost your team's efficiency and output without the need for expansion.
