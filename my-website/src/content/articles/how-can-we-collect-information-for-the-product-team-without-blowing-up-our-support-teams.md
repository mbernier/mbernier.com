To gather valuable customer insights without overburdening support teams, consider the following strategies:

1. **Implement Feedback Tools**: Use automated systems like surveys and feedback forms to collect customer input.

2. **Analyze Support Tickets**: Regularly review support tickets to identify common issues and feature requests.

3. **Cross-Functional Meetings**: Schedule periodic meetings between support and product teams to discuss recurring customer feedback.

4. **Dedicated Liaison**: Appoint a team member to act as a bridge between support and product departments.

These approaches ensure that valuable customer insights are captured efficiently without overwhelming support staff.
