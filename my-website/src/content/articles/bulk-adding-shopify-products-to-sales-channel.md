Expanding your product reach across multiple sales channels in Shopify can be achieved efficiently through bulk actions:

1. **Navigate to the Products Page**: Access your Shopify admin panel and go to the 'Products' section.

2. **Select Products**: Use the checkboxes to select multiple products you wish to add to new sales channels.

3. **Choose Sales Channels**: From the 'More actions' dropdown, select 'Add available channels' and choose your desired platforms.

4. **Confirm and Sync**: Ensure all product details meet the requirements of the new sales channels and confirm the addition.

Regularly updating and monitoring your product listings across channels ensures consistency and maximizes sales opportunities.
