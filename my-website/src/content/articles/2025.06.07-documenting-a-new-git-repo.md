# How I Audit a New Codebase with Cursor—Docs First, Code Second

You've just been handed 40k lines of code and a tight deadline. You can either spelunk through random directories or let an AI do the heavy lifting. Here's the workflow I've refined after onboarding to more repos than I can remember.

## 1. Clone, Create, and Configure

The moment I get repo access, I:

1. `git clone` locally.
2. Fire up **Cursor** and load my **global user-rules**—a living checklist that survives between projects. Tossing it below for anyone who wants to borrow:

```text
- Conventions‒extend existing code style and architecture—never reinvent.
- Self-documenting code‒expressive identifiers, minimal explanatory comments.
- DRY + KISS‒reuse abstractions and ship the simplest working solution.
- Separation of concerns‒models, repositories, routes, etc. live in their own packages.
- Explicit error handling‒no uncaught exceptions.
- No dummy data‒remove placeholders; tests use real fixtures, not mocks.
- Docstrings on every public symbol.
- Rule upkeep‒if ./cursor/rules is missing or stale, propose updates; flag any legacy .cursorrules file at once.
- Dev-friendly scripts‒shell scripts must print clear, colourised output.
- Python env‒ensure a local venv; create it if absent.
- DB default‒PostgreSQL unless project rules specify otherwise.
- Documentation goes in /docs/**/*.md
- Planning docs‒store in ./plans/**/*.md, use task lists (- [ ] / - [x]) and cross-link related docs.
- Architecture, Design, Functionality, Principles go in .cursor/rules/*.mdc—be pithy and link back to /docs/.
```

Cursor treats these as the prime directive for every suggestion it makes.

## 2. Branch for Docs Before Code

I create a dedicated `docs` branch. This seems backward to some folks, but it saves the team from "we'll write docs later" syndrome. The branch isolates massive auto-generated commits from functional changes, so reviewers can focus.

## 3. Ask Cursor the Big Seven

With rules loaded, I prompt Cursor to audit and document:

1. **What the codebase actually does** – A human-readable README overhaul.
2. **Backend & architecture** – Layers, packages, services, interactions.
3. **Database schema** – ERDs and explanations in `/docs/db/`.
4. **OpenAPI file** – If there's an API, Cursor reverse-engineers an OpenAPI-v3 spec.
5. **Frontend stack** – Component library, design tokens, theming rules.
6. **User flows** – From signup to power-user paths, diagrammed in Markdown + Mermaid.
7. **Core functionality** – Feature checklists with pointers to critical modules.

Depending on repo size, Cursor churns for a few minutes indexing and creating docs files. While I wait, I read the files that have already been produced. Sometimes I will start putting questions together or ideas for other docs that I would like to see from the next step.

## 4. Review, Refine, Repeat

Once Cursor finishes, I'll review what it found and ask it to adjust or create new docs based on my questions and notes.

## 5. Long-Term Payoff

Because my rules enforce `keep docs in sync`, every future PR that I make to features, functionality, database, interfaces, etc will trigger Cursor to update the relevant docs files automatically.

That means:

- **Onboarding new devs and AI agents** is quick.
- **The application vision is clearer** anyone who needs to know what the application is intended to do can look quickly and get what they need.
- **AI pair-programming** gets richer context, leading to better suggestions.

## TL;DR

Docs-first auditing with Cursor flips the onboarding script: you gain context up front and bake sustainability into the repo on day one. Try it on your next project—your future self (and your team) will thank you.
