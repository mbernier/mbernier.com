Most people assume developers will choose the “best” API. What they don’t realize is that “best” rarely means the one with the most features. It means the one with the best *experience.*

As someone who’s owned both external developer products (APIs, SDKs, onboarding) and internal platforms (used by engineers building those tools), I’ve seen exactly what makes developers choose one service over another—and stick with it.

### Developers choose ease

Your API might do something powerful. It might solve a complex problem in an elegant way. But if it takes two hours to get a hello world working—or worse, if the dev has to fill out a form to talk to sales before trying it—then it’s game over.

Developer time is expensive. It's mentally intense. And most devs are juggling multiple priorities. They’re trying to get something done, not evaluate your growth funnel.

So when your API:

- Doesn’t require jumping through hoops to access credentials  
- Offers clean, intuitive endpoints  
- Provides easy-to-run examples and quickstarts  
- Has SDKs that actually work across major languages  
- Surfaces helpful error messages and debug information  

That’s when developers lean in. It builds confidence. It builds velocity. And it builds trust.

### First impressions are product strategy

The first five minutes matter. The first API call is the start of the customer relationship. And the smoother that experience is, the more likely the developer is to choose *your* platform—not just for this project, but for the next one.

That’s not just good DX—that’s business strategy.

A clunky, confusing, or painful onboarding experience is a sign that your team doesn’t actually use the product themselves. It tells developers: “This tool was built for someone else.” And they’ll remember that.

I’ve seen this at large scale—at companies like Twilio, mParticle, and Temporal. When we got the onboarding and DX right, adoption grew faster, sales became easier, and support tickets dropped. The return on investment was clear.

### Devs don’t forget bad DX

If your docs are wrong, incomplete, or hidden behind a login wall, they won’t come back.

If your SDK throws unhelpful errors, they’ll uninstall it.

If they have to decode business logic to understand your rate limits, they’ll build their own alternative or find a competitor who values their time.

That’s why Developer Experience is *not* a developer-only concern. It’s a *product* concern. And more than that—it’s a company-wide signal.

Because the quality of your developer experience sends a clear message:

- When it’s great: “We care about our users. We’ve invested in your success.”
- When it’s bad: “This was bolted together. Good luck.”

Which message would you rather send?

### Beyond docs: The full DX surface area

Developer Experience isn’t just documentation. It’s not just an SDK. It’s every touchpoint that helps a developer try, understand, and use your API. That includes:

- The homepage and “Get Started” experience  
- How easy it is to sign up or get an API key  
- The consistency and predictability of endpoints  
- SDK ergonomics and versioning practices  
- Debuggability and observability  
- Rate limits and error responses  
- Examples, templates, and community content  
- How quickly someone can go from zero to success

The key is: **you are designing a workflow, not just a product.**

And developers notice when that workflow respects their time and mental energy.

### You can’t bolt on DX

Great DX isn’t something you fix at the end. You have to bake it into the product and design process from the beginning.

This means:

- Involving developer advocates and support early  
- Running usability testing with real developers  
- Observing onboarding friction in real-world scenarios  
- Prioritizing quickstarts, examples, and error clarity  
- Writing clear, focused, and navigable documentation  
- Monitoring DX metrics like time-to-first-success

It also means being willing to say no to features that would break consistency or add unnecessary complexity—even if they sound “cool.”

### Developer Experience drives long-term adoption

There’s a business case here: Good DX reduces support burden, accelerates onboarding, and leads to deeper product adoption.

But there’s also a human case: Developers are people. They want to use tools that feel well made, thoughtfully documented, and easy to integrate. They want to feel empowered, not confused.

And when you give them that experience, they become your advocates. They’ll recommend your API in Slack threads and Reddit comments. They’ll write blog posts and build on top of it. They’ll come back.

Because *you made it easy to win*.
