Customer experience is about bringing on new customers AND taking care of current customers.

I spent over a decade as a loyal customer of a major internet and cable company. During that time, my bills kept climbing. When I tried to negotiate, the answer was always the same: “These are the only offers we have.” So, I settled.

At one point, I was paying over $150/month for 200MB internet. Meanwhile, the company had a fiber trunk just 1,000 feet from my house but claimed it couldn’t bring fiber to the door. Then, a new provider entered the neighborhood—offering 1.2GB for $80/month, locked in for life + modem and wifi router all included.

No gimmicks, no games.

When I left the original company, they suddenly offered me an “Internet + Mobile phones + Home security for $50/month” package. That was infuriating. They could have proactively rewarded my loyalty at any point in the last 10 years. Instead, they only cared when I wanted to leave.

This isn’t how you treat long-term customers.

Today, the new company emailed me a surprise: “We’re upgrading your speed to 1.5GB. No extra charge.” That’s the kind of experience that makes you feel valued. No wonder my neighborhood is full of signs promoting them—they understand how to build trust.

The large internet and cable company won't see a huge impact on their overall revenue, but in this area people are tired of their monopoly and they are losing houses left and right. When they call to cancel and hear the offers, there's likely no way those customers will ever come back after being given these crazy offers in such a ridiculously insulting way. Personally, I'd rather pay the new company $30 more per month for less.

Companies that focus solely on acquiring new customers while neglecting existing ones are missing the bigger picture. Loyalty isn’t just earned with flashy offers when people signup. It’s about consistency, respect, and delivering value every step of the way.
