The reason people don't like process or people who bring process, is that they often don't take the time to understand why things are the way they are today before trying to change them.

I've seen it happen too many times. Someone steps in, eager to fix everything, without first asking, "Why does this exist?" It's no surprise their new process feels more like a roadblock than a solution. Processes aren't the enemy. Misguided ones are.

When I approach process improvement, I start by pausing and observing. Teams have rhythms, tools, and habits for a reason. By watching first, I understand what's working, what isn't, and where things can evolve. Without this step, changes are just guesses.

Once I know the lay of the land, I simplify. Processes tend to collect clutter over time. Old steps stay because "that's how it's always been done." But when you trim down to what truly matters, teams feel the difference. Meetings shrink. Reports disappear. Focus returns.

Next, I involve the team directly. Processes work best when the people using them have a say. Checkpoints for feedback aren't just a formality - they're where the best ideas surface. Often, those who live with the process daily spot opportunities others miss.

Finally, I adapt to the team, not the other way around. A process isn't one-size-fits-all. It must fit the culture, goals, and style of the people who rely on it. When a process feels natural, it gets used. When it feels forced, it gets ignored.

The truth is, process isn't about perfection. It's about enabling progress. If you take the time to understand, simplify, collaborate, and adapt, you'll create something that not only works but empowers.
