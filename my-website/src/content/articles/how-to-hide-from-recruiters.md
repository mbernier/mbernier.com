_Note: This was written in 2018 when the hiring market was significantly different from 2025._

If you're looking to minimize unsolicited attention from recruiters, consider the following steps:

1. **Adjust Your LinkedIn Settings**: Navigate to privacy settings and select options that limit visibility to recruiters.

2. **Use Generic Job Titles**: Instead of specific titles, use broader terms that are less likely to attract recruiter searches.

3. **Limit Online Presence**: Reduce the amount of personal information available on public platforms.

4. **Network Selectively**: Engage with professionals and communities relevant to your current interests, avoiding broader exposure.

By implementing these measures, you can maintain a lower profile and reduce unsolicited job offers.
