I spent more time searching for a download button in SquareSpace than it took me to find the solution so I could download what I needed. (Affiliate link at the bottom)

A friend needed help migrating their online course from SquareSpace to another platform. Easy enough, right? Well… not quite.

I couldn’t figure out how to download the videos from SquareSpace. There wasn’t a clear option anywhere. Frustration set in.

Then I found *BeyondSpace*. It’s a browser plugin designed to simplify SquareSpace workflows. And let me tell you—it was a lifesaver.

Here’s how it worked:
→ I installed the plugin.
→ Went to the asset library.
→ Clicked a dropdown menu that *magically appeared*.
→ Downloaded everything I needed.

What wasn’t possible by default became a 5-minute task, including setup and download time. It felt like magic.

Oh, and the best part? BeyondSpace lets you pay what you think the tool is worth. I chipped in, got the plugin link and instructions via email, and was downloading the content I needed in no time.

This experience reminded me how powerful the *right tools* can be. They don’t just save time—they save sanity.

If you’re wrangling with SquareSpace or struggling with content migrations, BeyondSpace might be worth a look. They have a ton of other features I haven't had a reason to explore, but if I was using SquareSpace all the time, I would start with this plugin.

This is an affiliate link, I get 30% of whatever you opt in to pay for the plugin -

Photo Note: I asked the AI for "stop watch" and this is what I got. Oh well.
